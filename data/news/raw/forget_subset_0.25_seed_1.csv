0,"Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has asked for forgiveness from the families of the 57 victims of this week's train crash.

In a Facebook message, Mr Mitsotakis said that ""in the Greece of 2023... two trains heading in different directions cannot run on the same line and no-one notice"".

Clashes with police were reported on Sunday as thousands joined a demonstration in the capital Athens.

They said seven officers were hurt and five arrests were made, the AFP news agency reports.

Some demonstrators set fire to rubbish bins and threw petrol bombs. Police responded by firing tear gas and stun grenades, clearing the central Syntagma Square of the protesters within a few minutes.

The protesters also reportedly released hundreds of black balloons into the sky in memory of the dead, with some holding signs reading ""Down with killer governments"".

On the night of 28 February, a passenger train and a freight train that were travelling in opposite directions ended up on the same track.

The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two caught fire and were almost completely destroyed.

The train crash has been widely attributed to human error.

A 59-year-old station master in Larissa, who was charged with manslaughter by negligence, appeared in court on Sunday and has been taken into custody.

His lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said the station master had admitted to having a share of responsibility in the accident. He faces between 10 years and life in jail if convicted.

But many in Greece see the crash as an accident that had been waiting to happen, and the railway workers' union blamed successive governments' ""disrespect"" towards Greek railways for leading to this ""tragic result"".

A government minister told the BBC that the lack of funding was the direct result of the strict terms of international bailouts imposed after the 2010 debt crisis.

The scene of the crash near Larissa

Union members were joined by residents of Athens and Thessaloniki in taking to the streets throughout the past week, shocked by the scale of the disaster. The protests were also attended by many students - several of the passengers on board one of the trains were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.

""The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,"" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.

Train drivers in Greece have said there have been long-running problems with the electronic systems that are supposed to warn them of danger ahead.

The transport minister, Kostas Karamanlis, also resigned as a ""sign of respect"" for the people who had died. Mr Karamanlis he was taking responsibility for the government's failure to modernise the country's railways in the three-and-a-half years it had been in power.

Immediately after the accident, the Greek government declared three days of national mourning and said the cost of the victims' funerals would be paid for from the public purse.

BBC Europe correspondent Nick Beake says the crash seems to be becoming a defining political issue for Greece as it prepares to face a general election in the spring.

Media reports have given 9 April as a possible date, but analysts say that date may now be pushed back.

DUP Leader says his party is happy to be involved in talks with all political parties

DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said he is hopeful of progress in the next few weeks in his talks with the government about restoring Stormont.

He was speaking after parties met the head of the civil service Jayne Brady.

Sir Jeffrey said discussions have reached an ""important stage"".

He added what happens then will determine of the government will be able to meet his party's demands on the protocol and ""be able to deliver what is required"" to restore the Executive.

He said his party's priority remained getting the solutions it needed on the Northern Ireland protocol which he said was continuing to cause harm.

The DUP collapsed power-sharing in February 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements.

He added that his party was happy to be involved in conversations around how to ease the budgetary pressures ""if and when"" the Executive was restored.

Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy says there was ""consensus"" within the Stormont parties that they need support with the ongoing financial pressures.

Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy says there is an elephant in the room around the DUP getting back to work

But Mr Murphy questioned ""the elephant in the room"" around when the DUP would get back to work.

He said: ""We are doing preparation work for negotiations that might not happen.""

He added that the financial situation in regards to public funding was getting worse not better.

This is the first hint of a timeline in the DUP's talks with the government.

According to the party leader we are reaching an ""important stage"" in the next few weeks and he is hopeful of progress.

That will coincide with a meeting of the UK and Irish governments in London hosted by Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris.

Could that be the moment when the government sets out its legislative plan to deal with the DUPs protocol concerns?

The government will be keen to pass any legislation before Westminster breaks for the summer recess on 20 July.

But don't expect a quick decision from the DUP.

The party may want assurances around a financial package to help plug Stormont's £1.1bn black hole.

They may also decide to reserve judgement until the new arrangements agreed in Windsor Framework are put into operation in October.

UUP leader Doug Beattie says the pace of executive restoration is ramping up

Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the pace towards the return of a Stormont executive is being ""ramped up"".

He said the all-party talks with the head of the civil service were positive.

Mr Beattie said those around the table talked about ""when"" the Executive is restored.

He said talks focused on the financial ask of the treasury to plug the £1.1bn black hole in Stormont's finances.

Alliance MP Stephen Farry says serious work is being done to move forward

Alliance MP Stephen Farry said that the talks and the progress being made should not be seen as a barrier to getting the Executive back up and running again.

But he added the talks on Thursday were a positive sign and that ""serious work"" was being done to put together a plan from the parties for the UK government on moving forward.

Mr Farry said: ""There is some degree of momentum building in this process but it's still early days.""

Sir Jeffrey also criticised Sinn Féin MP John Finucane over his planned attendance at an IRA commemoration at the weekend in Armagh.

He said his ""attendance was wrong on so many levels"".

He added they were ""building a fun day around celebrating volunteers who were one of the most feared killing machines in Northern Ireland during the troubles""

He urged Sinn Féin to think again about its involvement this weekend and to think of the impact on the victims families who still carry the hurt and pain.

Sinn Féin has previously said that ""everyone has the right to remember their dead"".

It's still unclear why he fled to North Korea. Pentagon officials are investigating the incident, and have said his safety is Washington's top concern.

We've learned from local media in the last few hours that King served two months in a South Korean jail on assault charges and was released on 10 July.

The report was carried out by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission

Some schools in Northern Ireland are teaching pupils that homosexuality is wrong in relationships and sex education (RSE).

A Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) report said ""many schools use language that shames and stigmatises young people"" who had sex.

Some told pupils that those who ""engage in casual sex must bear the consequences of their actions"".

The NIHRC investigated schools policies on the teaching of RSE.

The detailed investigation found most schools were not providing ""age-appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on access to abortion services"".

""Some schools actively contributed to the shame and stigma surrounding unplanned pregnancy and abortion, by making statements such as 'abortion is not a means of contraception and those who knowingly engage in casual sex must bear the consequences of their actions',"" the NIHRC report said.

It also said about two-thirds of post-primaries promoted abstinence in their sex education policies.

One school's policy stated that ""sexual abstinence before marriage and fidelity within it, will be presented as the positive and desirable option and an achievable reality"".

The commission recommended that schools should be monitored to ensure sex education is taught in ""an objective and non-judgemental manner"".

That should include ""detailed assessments of the content and delivery of lesson plans"".

The NIHRC was established following the Good Friday Agreement.

It has the power to conduct investigations and compel evidence.

Its investigation into relationships and sex education focused mainly on legal and policy matters but it also made recommendations on delivery of the subject in schools.

About three-quarters (149) of post-primaries in Northern Ireland provided evidence to the commission's investigation and 124 provided their RSE policies.

Some schools provided lesson plans and teaching notes, and experts were also consulted by the commission.

Speaking about the findings, NIHRC chief commissioner, Alyson Kilpatrick told Good Morning Ulster that ""an awful lot more needed to be done by a majority of schools in relation to age appropriate, comprehensive, scientifically accurate education and sexual reproductive health and rights"".

""The Department for Education needs to work with schools, consult with parents and children, to work out what the appropriate content should be and that it is delivered properly,"" said Ms Kilpatrick.

In 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) said RSE in Northern Ireland should be compulsory and comprehensive.

As a result, the Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris recently laid new regulations in parliament making teaching topics like abortion and prevention of pregnancy compulsory in schools in Northern Ireland.

He said he had a legal duty to act on the recommendations made in the CEDAW report.

But the change has been criticised by Protestant and Catholic church leaders.

The NIHRC investigation into RSE was carried out before Mr Heaton-Harris's move.

But the commission said that there must be monitoring to ""ensure that schools are meeting their new obligations"".

""It's very easy to have a policy or to have a list of things you are going to teach, but it is the actual teaching of them and the way in which they are taught which is so influential,"" said Ms Kilpatrick.

At present, each school in Northern Ireland has to teach sex education but can decide what to teach ""based on the ethos of their school,"" according to Department of Education (DE) guidance.

The NIHRC said that the majority of schools who submitted their RSE policy to the investigation ""still promoted the value of the 'sanctity of marriage'"", and related terms, such as ""permanent committed sexual relationship"", and ""married love"" in their RSE policies and school ethos.

""In addition to this idealisation and promotion of abstinence, marriage, and monogamy, many schools use language that shames and stigmatises young people who do engage in sexual practices,"" the report continued.

""Most schools also contributed to this association of shame with sexual activity, by attributing specific moral values and personal characteristics to those who engaged (or did not engage) in sexual behaviour.""

The NIHRC said about two-thirds of post-primaries taught pupils about contraception, but it was difficult to know if they offered accurate information.

In their RSE policies, some schools stated that ""they will present the Catholic teaching that 'the use of any artificial means of preventing procreation is not acceptable',"" the report said.

""Some schools even outline their beliefs that ""homosexuality"" is wrong,"" in their polices, the NIHRC said.

""For example, one [school] writes that 'the belief that homosexual acts are against the nature and purpose of human relationships will be presented to pupils',"" the report continued.

One third of schools who provided information to the NIHRC said their school would teach pupils that ""heterosexual relationships was the 'main' or 'ideal' context for sexual intimacy"".

The report also said most schools ""indirectly contribute to the societal victim-blaming and slut-shaming of women and girls.""

It said this was because they focused on how young people could stop themselves becoming victims of sexual abuse or violence, rather than challenging the perpetrators.

The NIHRC said that while their investigation showed some schools provided ""comprehensive and scientifically accurate"" relationship and sex education, the majority in Northern Ireland did not.

The commission concluded that the case for reforming the RSE curriculum was ""compelling"".

It provided 13 recommended reforms, including schools involving their students in drawing up RSE policies.

Catherine, Princess of Wales, made a surprise appearance playing the piano during the opening performance of Eurovision.

She played an instrumental piece, created by Joe Price and Kojo Samuel, recorded in Windsor Castle's Crimson Drawing Room earlier this month.

She wore a blue Jenny Packham dress and earrings belonging to the late queen.

The 10-second clip appeared in a performance by last year's winners Kalush Orchestra.

That performance also included contributions from Lord Lloyd-Webber, Sam Ryder, Ms Banks, Ballet Black, Bolt Strings and Joss Stone.

The opening Eurovision film showed Kalush Orchestra performing their winning entry Stefania, from the Maidan Nezalezhnosti metro station in Kyiv.

Sweden's Loreen won the competition for the second time with her pop anthem Tattoo.

The UK's entrant, Mae Muller, failed to replicate the success of Sam Ryder last year and finished in 25th place, out of 26.

Sweden's victory means it will host next year's event, which will mark the 50th anniversary of Abba's historic victory with Waterloo in 1974.

The instrumental piece was recorded in the Crimson Drawing Room of Windsor Castle

The princess, who has grade three piano and grade five theory, previously accompanied pop star Tom Walker on piano while he sang his previously unheard Christmas song For Those Who Can't Be Here during a 2021 carol service she hosted at Westminster Abbey.

The service, which was broadcast on ITV on Christmas Eve that year, paid tribute to the work of ""inspirational"" people who served their communities during the pandemic.

Madonna has said she is ""on the road to recovery"" in her first statement since a bacterial infection left her in a hospital's intensive care unit.

On social media, the singer said ""my focus now is my health"" and thanked her fans for their ""positive energy"".

The star, 64, said: ""I assure you, I'll be back with you as soon as I can!""

The pop star said her current plan"
2,"was to reschedule her forthcoming North American concerts and begin her Celebration Tour in the UK in October.

In the statement, she wrote: ""Thank you for your positive energy, prayers and words of healing and encouragement. I have felt your love.

""I'm on the road to recovery and incredibly grateful for all the blessings in my life.

""My first thought when I woke up in the hospital was my children.

""My second thought was that I did not want to disappoint anyone who bought tickets for my tour. I also didn't want to let down the people who worked tirelessly with me over the last few months to create my show. I hate to disappoint anyone.

""My focus now is my health and getting stronger and I assure you, I'll be back with you as soon as I can!

""The current plan is to reschedule the North American leg of the tour and to begin in October in Europe.""

She had been due to start the greatest hits tour in Canada on Saturday, 15 July. The European leg is scheduled to begin with four nights at London's O2 Arena from 14 October.

She finished her statement by saying: ""I couldn't be more grateful for your care and support.""

It comes two weeks after her manager Guy Oseary revealed the star had developed a ""serious bacterial infection"" on 24 June, which led to ""a several day stay in the ICU"".

At the time, he said she would ""need to pause all commitments, which includes the tour"".

Madonna's greatest hits span several decades - including Into The Groove (1985), Like A Prayer (1989), to Vogue (1990) and Hung Up (2005) to name a few.

In announcing the tour back in January, she told fans: ""I am excited to explore as many songs as possible in hopes to give my fans the show they have been waiting for.""

It is likely that she was in the final stages of a rehearsal regime when she became ill.

She called off a number of shows in her more experimental, theatre-based Madame X tour in 2019 and 2020 because of knee and hip injuries.

John McKenna played for Scotby Football Club in Carlisle, who have paid tribute to him

Tributes have been paid to a popular footballer who died after apparently falling from a hotel balcony in Ibiza.

John McKenna, 22, from Carlisle, Cumbria, had been on holiday when the tragedy happened on Friday at about 11:00 local time (10:00 BST).

The Scotby FC player, an electrician, is reported to have fallen from the third floor of his San Antonio hotel.

His Sunday league club said it had ""lost a legend, a brilliant player but an even better person"".

It added that he would be ""never forgotten but loved always. RIP big John.""

Friend and former Carlisle United player Josh Dixon, who went to school with Mr McKenna, also paid tribute and said he was ""absolutely heartbroken"".

""One of my closest mates all the way through school,"" he wrote.

""Wherever you went you would put a smile on someone's face, will be a huge miss to us all. Rest easy big man.""

Flowers have been left outside the club's pavilion, alongside a football shirt.

Scotby FC has received messages of support from other teams across the league

The Cumberland Football Association said it was ""so sorry to hear this tragic news"".

""Our thoughts are with John's family and friends as well as his teammates in the AFC Scotby family at this time and always"".

Clubs from the Carlisle City Premier Sunday League have also sent their condolences, as well as other teams from the county.

The UK Foreign Office said it was supporting the family of a British man who died in Ibiza and was in touch with the Spanish island's authorities.

An investigation is continuing into what happened, which is being led by the Civil Guard.

Kim Jong Un, seen here in 2017, is known to be a heavy smoker

British American Tobacco is to pay $635m (£512m) plus interest to US authorities after a subsidiary admitted selling cigarettes to North Korea in violation of sanctions.

The US authorities said the settlement related to BAT activity in North Korea between 2007 and 2017.

BAT's head Jack Bowles said ""we deeply regret the misconduct"".

The US has imposed severe sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile activities.

Tuesday's settlement was between BAT and America's Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.

BAT is one of the world's largest tobacco multinationals and one of the UK's 10 biggest companies. It owns major cigarette brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Pall Mall.

In a statement, BAT said it had entered into a ""deferred prosecution agreement with DOJ and a civil settlement agreement with OFAC, and an indirect BAT subsidiary in Singapore has entered into a plea agreement with DOJ"".

The DOJ said BAT had also conspired to defraud financial institutions in order to get them to process transactions on behalf of North Korean entities.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is known to be a heavy smoker. Last year the US attempted to get the UN Security Council to ban tobacco exports to North Korea, but this was vetoed by Russia and China.

At a briefing on Tuesday, the DOJ's assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen said the settlement was the ""culmination of a long-running investigation"", describing it as ""the single largest North Korean sanctions penalty in the history of the Department of Justice"".

He said that BAT was engaged in an ""elaborate scheme to circumvent US sanctions and sell tobacco products to North Korea"" via subsidiaries.

""Between 2007 and 2017 these third-party companies sold tobacco products to North Korea and received approximately $428m.""

Criminal charges were also revealed against North Korean banker Sim Hyon-Sop, 39, and Chinese facilitators Qin Guoming, 60, and Han Linlin, 41, for facilitating sales of tobacco to North Korea.

A $5m (£4.4m) bounty was put for any information leading to the arrest or conviction of Mr Sim, and $500,000 (£402,905) rewards for each of the other two suspects.

They were accused of buying leaf tobacco for North Korean state-owned cigarette makers and falsifying documents to trick US banks into processing transactions worth $74m. North Korean manufacturers including one owned by the military made about $700m thanks to these deals.

Pyongyang has for years faced multiple rounds of tough sanctions in response to its ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests.

However that has not deterred Mr Kim from continuing to develop the country's weapons programme.

The Birmingham to Crewe leg of high speed railway HS2 will be delayed by two years to cut costs.

The government suggested Euston station's opening could also be delayed as an ""affordable"" design is worked on.

Transport secretary Mark Harper blamed soaring prices and said he was ""committed"" to the line linking London, the Midlands and North of England.

HS2 has been beset by delays and cost rises. In 2010, it was expected to cost £33bn but is now expected to be £71bn.

Mr Harper said ""sign"
3,"ificant inflationary pressure"" and increased project costs meant the government was to ""rephase construction by two years"".

He said the decision had been ""difficult"" but that it was part of ""controlling inflation and reducing government debt"".

Mark Thurston, chief executive of HS2 Ltd, recently told the BBC that he and the government were examining the phasing of the build and the timing.

John Foster from business group CBI said the delay would harm investor confidence in the rail sector.

""Delays to projects may create short-term savings, but they can ultimately lead to higher overall costs and slow down the UK's transition to a better, faster and greener transport network,"" Mr Foster added.

Labour said the decision to pause the HS2 at Birmingham was ""astonishing"".

Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said the party had committed to delivering HS2 in full if it gets into government, and to partly funding the work by its green prosperity plan.

The head of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, Henri Murison, said the delay was ""disappointing"" and ""holds back economic benefits"".

The project is grappling with the rising cost of materials due to the high rate of inflation.

The government hopes that the delays will allow it to spread the cost over a longer period of time, making it more affordable by reducing annual expenditure.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who will outline his Budget next week, wants debt to fall as a percentage of GDP within five years - a target explicitly set by the Prime Minister.

Michael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Lichfield in Staffordshire, which contains part of the HS2 line, said he would ask the government whether the delay ""marks the end of HS2 north of Birmingham for good and whether HS2 will make good the damage already done in southern Staffordshire"".

He added: ""Simply saying the project is delayed is not good enough. The area has been blighted by whole fields turned into construction sites.""

Last week, Mr Thurston said the impact of inflation had been ""significant"" in the past year, affecting the costs of raw material, labour, energy and fuel.

""We're looking at the timing of the project, the phasing of the project, we're looking at where we can use our supply chain to secure a lot of those things that are costing us more through inflation,"" he said.

HS2 trains are scheduled to carry the first passengers between Old Oak Common station in West London and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033.

Euston station in London is currently scheduled to open later, by 2035. Further stretches to Crewe and then to Manchester are due by 2034 and 2041.

Most of the HS2 leg to Leeds was scrapped in 2021.

Buzzfeed is to close its news site and cut its workforce by 15%, chief executive Jonah Peretti has said.

It comes as the digital media company faces serious financial challenges, including a slump in advertising spending.

Calling the decisions ""deeply painful"", Mr Peretti said he could not invest more in the unprofitable news site.

He said the firm would focus on delivering news via the HuffPost, which Buzzfeed took over two years ago.

""Our industry is hurting and ready to be reborn,"" he said in a memo to staff. ""We are taking great pains today, and will begin to fight our way to a bright future.""

Founded in 2006, Buzzfeed was once one of the trendiest names in online media, known for its quizzes and viral content, as well as a serious news operation.

But the firm, which employed more than 1,300 people globally at the end of last year, has shifted away from news, as bringing in ad revenue and audiences became more difficult and other lines of business, such as producing custom content, grew more quickly.

It listed on the stock exchange in 2021, but raised far less money than it had hoped.

""While layoffs are occurring across nearly every division, we've determined that the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization,"" Mr Peretti wrote to staff.

Many other advertising-reliant companies, including media firms and tech giants such as Facebook's owner Meta, have been making job cuts in recent months, while investors have been forced to reassess the values of upstart news ventures such as Vice News and Vox Media. News company Insider also revealed plans on Thursday to reduce its workforce by 10% or about 95 jobs.

Mr Peretti said his company, which will continue to operate HuffPost, its food brand Tasty, Complex Networks, and its namesake website, had faced wider challenges but he also blamed himself.

He said he had been ""slow to accept"" the difficulties of making money from online news with distribution dominated by big tech platforms. The firm should have generated more revenue after acquiring Complex in 2021, which runs the music site Complex and other brands, he added.

""I could have managed these changes better as the CEO of this company and our leadership team could have performed better despite these circumstances."" he said.

In her own memo to staff, parts of which she shared on social media, Buzzfeed News editor-in-chief Karolina Waclawiak said the company should have tried to build a business around its news site earlier, describing the closure as ""avoidable"".

She said the failure was indicative of a wider crisis in journalism and she feared the results if subscription-based news models were the only ones that survive.

""The implication is that only people who can afford to pay for it will have access to high quality information while everyone else will need to parse through the rampant misinformation that is widely shared across social platforms,"" she wrote. ""The consequences of this are dire.""

Buzzfeed had already announced several rounds of layoffs in recent years, including one in December that affected roughly 170 people or 12% of staff.

The latest cuts involve about 180 jobs. Buzzfeed said it expected to incur $7m (£5.6m) - $11m (£8.8m) in severance and other charges connected to the move.

Some of the news staff may find roles in other parts of the firm, the company said.

Shares fell 20% on Thursday on the news, reducing Buzzfeed's market value to about $100m (£80m) - a fraction of the more than $1.5bn (£1.2bn) valuation investors were reportedly discussing just two years ago.

Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood has been questioned twice under police caution over five alleged sex offences.

In a statement, the Metropolitan Police confirmed they are now investigating five accusations of offences alleged to have happened between 1982 and 2016.

Detectives say they interviewed a 65-year-old man under caution on 15 March and 4 April. There has been no arrest.

It comes after BBC News and the Guardian uncovered allegations from 18 women. He denied those allegations.

In April last year, a number of women accused the former Radio 1 DJ of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017.

They also accused him of abusing his position in the music industry. Some of the women told us they encountered Mr Westwood when they were under 18. One says that she was only 14 when Mr Westwood first had sex with her.

The DJ stepped down from his Capital Xtra radio show after the allegations emerged.

Last August the BBC launched an external inquiry into what the corporation did and did not know about Tim Westwood's conduct during his nearly 20 years working there. That inquiry is still ongoing.

BBC News has attempted to contact Mr Westwood for comment.

The cancer campaigner, blogger, broadcaster and former teacher, Dame Deborah James, has died aged 40.

She had been receiving end-of-life care for bowel cancer at home and had raised millions for cancer research.

The host of the BBC's You, Me and the Big C podcast was given a damehood in May in recognition of her fundraising.

Dame Deborah, a mother of two, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016. Her family described her as ""amazing"" and an ""inspiration"".

They announced her death in a post on her Instagram page. ""We are deeply saddened to announce the death of Dame Deborah James; the most amazing wife, daughter, sister, mummy,"" it said.

She passed away peacefully surrounded by her family.

Her family said Dame Deborah shared her experience of cancer to ""raise awareness, break down barriers, challenge taboos and change the conversation around cancer"".

""Even in her most challenging moments, her determination to raise money and awareness was inspiring.""

Dame Deborah was praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, having shared her experiences of treatment and daily life since her diagnosis in 2016.

A deputy head teacher, she started a cancer blog, before writing for the Sun and becoming a BBC broadcaster.

But on 9 May she announced that she was no longer receiving active care and did not know how long she had left.

""My body just can't continue any more,"" she said in a post on her @bowelbabe Instagram account.

She also launched a new fund, called the Bowelbabe fund, to raise money for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients.

It surpassed £1m in less than 24 hours - smashing her initial goal of £250,000 - and has now raised almost £7m.

In May, she was given a damehood by Prince William at her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, where she had chosen to stay.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - who donated to the research fund - praised her ""tireless efforts"" and thanked her for ""giving hope"" to those living with the disease.

For her part, Dame Deborah said William's visit was ""surreal"".

""You can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind,"" she said.

The money raised through her Bowelbabe fund will support Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Hospital - a specialist cancer treatment facility.

Bowel Cancer UK, of which Dame Deborah was a patron, said she had turned her bowel cancer diagnosis ""into an incredible force for good"" and would save countless lives through her campaigning.

Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the former teacher had an ""incredible energy"" and a ""marvellous knack of making things happen"".

Paying tribute to the presenter's awareness-raising work, Ms Edwards said: ""She had this incredible power to connect with people. She leaves a tremendous legacy behind her"".

Dame Deborah campaigned to raise awareness about bowel cancer, urging people to check for symptoms, during and after her treatment.

Following one operation, while in an anaesthetic daze, she ordered a poo costume online - which she would wear while recording her podcast.

Signing off her final podcast in May, she said: ""Check your poo. Come on. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo.

""I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere. So maybe I should leave on that final word. Check your poo.""

Regular bowel cancer screening is available to everyone aged 60-74 and this programme is expanding to include everyone aged 50-59. This expansion is happening gradually over four years and started in April last year.

People in England aged 60-74 who are registered with a GP are automatically sent an NHS bowel cancer screening kit every two years.

If you are outside this age group, you should still be aware of what bowel cancer symptoms are and visit your GP if you have any concerns.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson described her as ""an inspiration to so many"", while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said her charity work was ""truly inspirational... even in the most challenging moments"".

The director general of the BBC, Tim Davie said she was a ""true inspiration"" and the way she talked about cancer ""moved the nation, inspired change and undoubtedly saved lives"".

Dame Deborah co-hosted You, Me and the Big C with Rachael Bland and Lauren Mahon

Dame Deborah began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer.

They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters, including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest about illnesses.

Bland died aged 40 in September 2018, two years after being diagnosed with breast cancer.

BBC 5 Live presenter Tony Livesey, who was a friend of Dame Deborah and did her final broadcast interview earlier this month, said the campaigner was ""one of the most remarkable women I've ever met"".

""All the fame she's had was a by-product of just the work she wanted to do to save one life,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

BBC News presenter George Alagiah, who is living with bowel cancer, recalled speaking to Dame Deborah at the Royal Marsden Hospital.

Mr Alagiah told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the campaigner answered his questions about the symptoms he might experience with the illness.

The newsreader said he was struck by Dame Deborah's ""sheer generosity"" and that their chat was ""typical of what I now know she was capable of doing and did for so many others"".

Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Lucie Kon, a BBC producer and friend of Dame Deborah, called the podcast host ""the most amazing human out of anyone I know"" and said she would be ""alive in my mind forever"".

Lucie said Dame Deborah showed that cancer does not have to be a ""life sentence"", and that the 40-year-old ""didn't want to be a victim"".

Dame Deborah's first book, called F*** You Cancer: How to face the big C, live your life and still be yourself, was published in 2018.

Her second book, How To Live When You Could Be Dead, is due to be released on 18 August.

A decision to quash a Department of Health policy on paying for care costs in nursing homes has been welcomed by the NI commissioner for older people.

The commissioner, Eddie Lynch, was reacting to a decision by High Court judge Mr Justice Scoffield.

The judge ruled the department failed to properly consider the impact on elderly people who could potentially lose life savings to meet health costs.

He said it had been responsible for a ""plain dereliction in its duty"".

The commissioner, Mr Lynch, took a judicial review on behalf of Robin McMinnis.

The 75-year-old, who is quadriplegic and has complex medical needs, has been paying for his care while living in a Belfast nursing home.

The Continuing Healthcare Policy relates to the assessment of whether a person's needs can be met in a hospital which will not cost anything or is social-care related which could incur costs.

The judicial review highlighted that the criteria and threshold for when a person should pay for their care is unclear and operates differently between each health trust.

Eddie Lynch said the High Court ruling was a win for older people

All older people with assets worth more than £23,250 have to pay for their social care.

A change to the policy, introduced in February 2021, uses a single criteria question where people are asked: ""Can your care needs be met properly in any other setting other than a hospital?""

Those people who are placed in a nursing home have to pay, while others who say they cannot go to a nursing home instead have their care paid for while in hospital.

The judge ruled that Mr McMinnis was unfairly refused the funding and ordered the Belfast Trust to reconsider his application.

He said he also proposed ""to quash the decision of the department to adopt the 2021 policy"".

Mr McMinnis said it had been ""a long journey for me personally over the past six years with many setbacks"".

""It has been a matter of principle for me, knowing that many others have been disqualified or were unaware of the Continuing Healthcare Policy,"" he continued.

Reacting to the judgement, Mr Lynch said he was delighted for Mr McMinnis.

""This is also a win for the many older people who have contacted my office over the past number of years in relation to issues with continuing healthcare assessments, all of whom will now be entitled to receive the fair assessment they deserve,"" he said.

On Tuesday he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster the ruling shows the system ""was not fit for purpose"".

""The bottom line here was older people were being failed by the system,"" the commissioner said.

""Older people whose costs should have been picked up by the NHS were paying for their care.

""People were left high and dry, people who were entitled to this [financial] support because the system was not set up properly to give them a fair assessment.""

He said this ruling ""overturns and quashes a policy that was ageist"".

Mr Lynch said now that the policy has been quashed, the onus is on the Department of Health to ""come up with a policy that treats people fairly"".

The department said it ""will be considering the judgement, before deciding on next steps"".

Chinese-owned video streaming app TikTok says it will offer text-only posts as competition between social media giants heats up.

The platform says the new feature gives users ""another way to express themselves"".

Earlier this month, TikTok launched a new music streaming service to rival platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.

And on Monday, Elon Musk's Twitter ditched its famous blue bird logo and switched to a black and white X.

TikTok users will now be offered three options on the app - whether to post photos, videos or text.

They will also be able to customise posts by adding sound, location or Duets, which are video reactions to posts by other TikTok users.

""These features make it so your text posts are just as dynamic and interactive as any video or photo post,"" TikTok said.

TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, recently launched a new music streaming service, TikTok Music, in Brazil and Indonesia.

Last week, the company also rolled out a beta version of the service in Singapore, Mexico and Australia.

A spokesman said it would allow users to ""listen, share and download the music they have discovered on TikTok, as well as share their favourite tracks and artists with their TikTok community"".

The app is testing other features including a new landscape mode with select users around the world.

In 2021, TikTok became the world's most popular online destination as it had more hits than US search engine giant Google.

That year, the app also said it had more than one billion active users globally.

Competition between rival social media firms - such as Instagram owner Meta and X, Mr Musk's rebranded Twitter platform - have heated up in recent weeks.

This month, Meta's new Threads platform went live on Apple and Android app stores in 100 countries, including the UK.

Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg later said his company's Threads platform had signed up more than 100 million users in less than five days.

Also this week, the blue bird branding on social network Twitter was replaced by a logo featuring a white X on a black background.

The term tweets will also be changed to ""x's"", according to Mr Musk.

Two Greek air force pilots have died after a plane crashed while fighting wildfires on the Greek island of Evia, officials say.

The water-bombing plane crashed while battling a forest fire near Platanistos, the defence ministry said.

The pilots were named as 34-year-old Cdr Christos Moulas and his co-pilot, 27-year-old Pericles Stefanidis.

An intense European heatwave has also sparked wildfires across Sicily, Algeria and Tunisia.

Greek TV showed the Canadair aircraft flying low to drop"
6,"water on a fire before turning sharply into a hillside and bursting into flames.

State broadcaster ERT said the plane crashed over the town of Karystos on the island, where a fire was burning.

The plane was among at least three other aircraft and about 100 firefighters tackling fires on Evia.

Defence Minister Nikos Dendias said the pilots lost their lives ""in the line of duty... while attempting to protect the lives and property of citizens, as well as the environment of our country"".

A three-day mourning period has been declared in the Greek armed forces, the defence ministry said.

Rescuers at the site of the plane crash after a water drop in Platanistos on the island of Evia, Greece

Emergency teams were fighting flames non-stop on dozens of fronts on Tuesday, Greek government minister Vassilis Kikilias said.

Crete, the largest Greek island, has been put on high alert, with residents warned there is an ""extreme risk"" of fire.

More evacuation flights are taking place from Rhodes, while more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from homes and resorts in recent days.

An international panel of scientists has said the current conditions could not possibly have happened without human-caused climate change.

Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, the Italian island of Sicily has been battling fires overnight after weeks of record-breaking temperatures.

Local media warned that the city of Palermo was ""encircled"" by fires, including a blaze that forced the temporary closure of Palermo airport on Tuesday.

Northern Italy has been reeling from violent storms and high winds that have uprooted trees and lifted roofs off buildings.

In some places, tennis ball-sized hailstones injured people, damaged cars and destroyed crops.

Firefighters are battling flames near the village of Vati on the island of Rhodes in Greece

Algeria has also been battling to control wildfires along its Mediterranean coast that have killed at least 34 people.

A number of people suffered burn injuries and smoke inhalation, while more than 1,500 were evacuated from fires in 16 provinces.

An outbreak of 97 fires had mostly been brought under control, but 13 were still raging on Tuesday afternoon, the interior ministry said.

In neighbouring Tunisia, where temperatures up to 49C (120F) were recorded, officials said authorities were investigating the causes of forest fires that had broken out across the country in recent days.

One of the most severe fires in Maloula, near the Algerian border, has been brought under control after thousands were evacuated.

A forestry official has called for anyone found to have started the fires deliberately to be prosecuted ""with an iron fist"".

Could powerful heatwaves and summer wildfires, which have devastated communities and displaced tourists in Greece, become the new normal in Europe?

Zakhar Prilepin is one of Russia's most celebrated authors and a veteran supporter of ultranationalist politics

A Russian pro-war writer who was seriously injured in a car bombing said he would not be intimidated by the apparent attempt on his life.

Zakhar Prilepin, a vehement supporter of Russia's campaign in Ukraine, said he survived because he was driving.

The bomb was under the passenger seat, and killed his friend Alexander Shubin, he wrote in a Telegram post.

Investigators claim that a suspect, Alexander Permyakov, has admitted working for Ukraine.

Initial reports suggested that Prilepin had been in the passenger seat and his driver had been killed, but Prilepin said he had been driving himself.

The explosion broke both his legs, he said - and added that he had dropped off his daughter ""five minutes before"".

""You will not intimidate anyone,"" he warned those behind the attack. ""Thanks to everyone who prayed, because it should have been impossible to survive such an explosion,"" he added.

The prize-winning author and veteran of Moscow's bloody wars in Chechnya is one of Russia's most celebrated writers, and before 2014 was a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin.

But in recent years Prilepin - long known for his involvement in Russian ultranationalist politics - has seemingly reconciled with Mr Putin and become a strident supporter of the Ukraine invasion.

The 47-year-old has admitted fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and has called for the ""return of Kyiv to Russia"".

Last year a group founded by Prilepin called on officials to ""purge the cultural space"" of all who oppose the conflict.

Russia's Investigative Committee (SK), which handles serious crimes including terrorism, accuses Alexander Permyakov of having detonated a remote-controlled bomb, wrecking Prilepin's Audi.

The bomb was allegedly planted on the road and detonated remotely

The SK says he was caught in a neighbouring village. The region is more than 425km (265 miles) east of Moscow.

He ""admitted doing an assignment for the Ukrainian secret services"", the SK alleges.

The partisan group Atesh, which is made up of Ukrainians and Crimean Tartars, claimed it was behind the attack on Prilepin.

""We had a feeling that sooner or later he would be blown up,"" they wrote on Telegram. ""He was not driving alone, but with a surprise on the underside of the car.""

Ukraine's security service (SBU) issued its standard response, declining to comment on the attack or to a Russian foreign ministry allegation that Ukraine - backed by the US government - targeted Prilepin.

The attack is the latest to target high-profile supporters of President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.

Vladlen Tatarsky was killed last month. The blogger had reported from the Ukraine front line and gained notoriety last year after posting a video filmed inside the Kremlin in which he said: ""We will defeat everyone, we will kill everyone, we will rob everyone as necessary. Just as we like it.""

Activist Darya Trepova, 26, was later arrested and was charged with terrorism following the publication of a video - believed to have been recorded under duress - in which she admitted bringing a statuette to the café that later blew up.

And in August 2022, Darya Dugina - the daughter of a close ally of Mr Putin - was killed in a suspected car bombing near Moscow.

It is thought her father, the Russian ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin, who is known as ""Putin's brain"", may have been the intended target of that attack.

The UK is set to review the artificial intelligence (AI) market to make sure its benefits are available for everyone and that no single firm will dominate.

The investigation by the competition watchdog will look at the software behind chatbots like ChatGPT.

The industry is facing scrutiny over the pace at which it is developing technology to mimic human behaviour.

AI's rapid take-up has sparked fears of job losses, privacy and the potential to circulate misleading information.

Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said so-called foundation models such as the software behind ChatGPT had the potential to ""transform the way businesses compete as well as drive substantial economic growth"".

But she said it was crucial that the potential benefits were ""readily accessible to UK businesses and consumers while people remain protected from issues like false or misleading information"".

The move comes days after Geoffrey Hinton - a man widely seen as the godfather of artificial intelligence - quit his job, warning about the growing dangers from developments in the field, which enables technology to create images or text that are barely distinguishable from the work of humans.

Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of the advertising companies WPP and S4, told the BBC that AI would be an ""industrial revolution"" and ""another major shift in technology , rivalling, maybe even more significant than the iPhone and similar developments"".

The digital advertising industry is already seeing the impact, he added, with firms using AI to ""hyper personalise"" ads for consumers.

""Obviously that raises all sorts of issues around regulation as well,"" Sir Martin told the Today programme.

He added that currently two companies dominate the AI space - Microsoft, which owns ChatGPT, and Google which has launched a rival chatbot called Bard."
7,"

Sir Martin said the CMA had shown its willingness to stop tech firms having too much power, for example by blocking Microsoft's planned takeover of UK gaming giant Activision Blizzard last week which sparked a furious reaction from the tech giant.

The US competition watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission, has also called for tougher regulation of AI.

""The [UK's] regulator is saying bigger is bad,"" Sir Martin said. ""But the cost of developing [AI] technologies is so huge and thereby hangs the dilemma... If you restrict it you will restrict progress.""

Some have warned that tools such as Bard and ChatGPT - which can write essays, do computer coding and even have conversations in a human-like way - could end up displacing hundreds of millions of jobs.

Mr Hinton told the BBC that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were ""quite scary"", and that they could soon overtake the level of information that a human brain holds.

""Right now, they're not more intelligent than us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be.""

In March, key figures in artificial intelligence called for powerful AI systems to halted for at least six months amid concerns about the threats they posed.

Twitter chief Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak were among those to sign an open letter warning of the risks, and say the race to develop AI systems is out of control.

The CMA said the development of AI had raised several other issues, including safety; security; privacy; intellectual property and copyright; and human rights.

The watchdog said it would specifically be looking at the impact on competition, with a view to creating a set of ""guiding principles"" to protect consumers as AI develops.

The heads of Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are due to meet US Vice President Kamala Harris to discuss issues surrounding AI on Thursday.

Reuters reported that the invitation to the companies included President Joe Biden's ""expectation that companies like yours must make sure their products are safe before making them available to the public"".

Coverage: Ball-by-ball commentary of every County Championship match across BBC local radio, BBC Sport website and app with live text commentary on each day's play

There is blossom on the trees, the mowers have been dusted off and birds - and cricketers - have been migrating back to the UK from warmer climes. Oh, and it is raining. It can only mean one thing - the 2024 County Championship campaign begins on Friday.

Bazball might have lost a little of its buzz but some of its biggest names will feature in the early stages of the season.

BBC Sport takes a look at who will be involved and some other things to look out for this year.

Surrey looking for three in a row

Not accounting for the Covid-hit seasons of 2020 and 2021, last season was effectively Surrey's third Championship title win from the last four, having also won it in 2018.

Their squad is largely the same as last season, with England batter Dan Lawrence a notable addition, arriving from Essex. Overseas stars Sean Abbott and Kemar Roach will return to the Oval though all-rounder Aaron Hardie's planned stint has been called off by Cricket Australia.

Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart, who is leaving the role at the end of the campaign, says they are hungry for more success.

""Last March I said 'we want to attack this year not defend it',"" he told BBC Radio London.

""My dad [Surrey great Mickey Stewart] still goes on about being part of the team that won it seven times on the trot. We have now won it back-to-back. And adding Dan Lawrence gives us another top-class player, and more appetite to win it again.""

Head coach Gareth Batty said the club's mentality ""has to be about winning things"" and they do not want to stop at one trophy.

""Knowing Alec isn't going to be around in a full-time capacity next year - for those that are driven by the emotional side it's a lovely add-on, for those who aren't it doesn't matter, it's still going to be winning - this group is driven for success,"" Batty said.

Sounds ominous for the rest, so who can stop them?

Essex hung around longer than anyone last season and took the title race to the final round, though they finished 20 points adrift in second place.

One veteran Test opener has replaced another at Chelmsford with South Africa's Dean Elgar signed to fill the big shoes of the retiring Sir Alastair Cook. There's also an eye on the future as all-action keeper/batter Jordan Cox has been tempted over the Thames from Kent.

The loss of Lawrence will certainly sting, but there are a host of talented young batters waiting in the wings and any side who can toss the ball to Jamie Porter, Sam Cook or Simon Harmer will fancy their chances.

Essex were only denied victory over Surrey by the weather last season and this campaign, for the first time in five years, the two will face each other home and away. The final game of the season sees them face-off at Chelmsford.

Lancashire took a step backwards in 2023 after finishing as runners-up in all three competitions the previous year.

In a winter of change behind the scenes, head coach Glen Chapple has been replaced by Dale Benkenstein.

The county have pulled off a coup with the arrival of Australia spinner Nathan Lyon for the first half of the campaign. Plenty of talk has been about how they pair him with Tom Hartley, fresh from a 22-wicket haul in England's Test series in India.

Hampshire have quietly gone about their business after a pair of third-placed finishes. They have added promising Sussex top-order batter Ali Orr and Australia paceman Michael Neser.

Will that be enough to end a 52-year wait for the title? James Vince, Liam Dawson, Mohammad Abbas, Keith Barker and Kyle Abbott are not getting any younger, but they did beat Essex and Surrey to finish the 2023 campaign.

Durham's last game in Division One came against Hampshire in 2016 before they were relegated by the ECB at the end of the season, giving Hampshire a reprieve. They make a triumphant return to the top flight with a game against... Hampshire.

They have plenty of quality in the pace bowling department. Australia's Scott Boland has signed an overseas deal until the end of July and they already have Ben Raine and Matthew Potts, who bagged 50 wickets apiece last year.

South Africa batter David Bedingham returns for a full summer, while England skipper Ben Stokes also hopes to be involved at the start of the season.

Worcestershire have seen New Road flooded seven times across the winter and their two home games in their opening six fixtures will be played at Kidderminster - with talk of them potentially leaving the ground permanently.

While they have added West Indies all-rounder Jason Holder and Nathan Smith of New Zealand, in addition to Rob Jones from Lancashire and Northants duo Josh Cobb and Tom Taylor, their quest to avoid an immediate return to Division Two has not been helped by bowlers Dillon Pennington and Josh Tongue, and batter Jack Haynes, all moving to Notts.

Nottinghamshire will be skippered by Haseeb Hameed, taking over from Steven Mullaney, in what feels like a new era at Trent Bridge with Samit Patel, Jake Ball and Stuart Broad all departing.

There has been another change of captain at Somerset where Lewis Gregory succeeds Tom Abell, and though Ball arrives from Notts, one player who will not be at Taunton this summer is Aussie all-rounder Will Sutherland, who has pulled out of his stint through injury.

Somerset have famously never won the title and went five without a win to start last season. They will hope the return of Matt Renshaw early in the season gives them more momentum.

Will Rhodes has also stepped down as Warwickshire captain, though George Garton has joined the Bears from Sussex.

The Bears, champions in 2021, start against rivals"
8,"Worcestershire at Edgbaston and will hope to improve on a fourth-placed finish last year.

Daniel Bell-Drummond is the new Kent skipper. He will be hoping the addition of Matt Parkinson from Lancashire, and overseas players Wes Agar and Beyers Swanepoel, will help them take 20 wickets and avoid another brush with relegation.

Brook to star in Division Two

Yorkshire start against Leicestershire at Headingley and could select Harry Brook, who missed England's Test tour to India and pulled out of the IPL for personal reasons, but will be available for the first five games of the Championship season.

Joe Root is set to start a six-game domestic stint later this month too.

The man who brought Ottis Gibson in as coach, Darren Gough, has left his role as managing director of cricket while Colin Graves is back as chair for a season where the White Rose look poised for a promotion push.

Elsewhere Middlesex hope the signing of Derbyshire talisman Leus du Plooy will spearhead an immediate return to the top flight, though seamer Tim Murtagh will be watching from the sidelines after retirement.

Northants, who finished bottom of Division One last season, have Australian Chris Tremain and India's Karun Nair for the start of the season, while Nair's countryman Prithvi Shaw returns from June.

Sussex saw Ali Orr depart for Hampshire this winter but have added the experience of John Simpson from Middlesex and Lancashire's Danny Lamb, while West Indies bowler Jayden Seales and India batter Cheteshwar Pujara are around early in the campaign.

A deal for Leicestershire seamer Chris Wright was cancelled for personal reasons but they do have England paceman Ollie Robinson available for the start of the season.

Leicestershire have lost Colin Ackermann and Calum Parkinson to Durham, but Liam Trevaskis is coming the other way, while Ben Mike and Ben Cox have arrived from Yorkshire and Worcestershire respectively, and Scott Currie joins on loan from Hampshire.

Glamorgan have appointed Grant Bradburn as head coach and installed Sam Northeast as Championship skipper, after David Lloyd's move to Derbyshire, while Mason Crane will spend a season on loan at Sophia Gardens from Hampshire. Neser's move in the opposite direction will not help Glamorgan's top-two hopes.

Lloyd, who takes over the captaincy from Du Plooy, is followed to Derbyshire by veteran Patel, and Aneurin Donald and Ross Whiteley from Hampshire.

Mark Alleyne is back in charge at Gloucestershire - who were winless last season - after Benkenstein's move to Old Trafford, while Cameron Bancroft and Beau Webster have signed overseas deals after spells with Somerset and Essex respectively.

Relegated from Div One: Middlesex and Northamptonshire

Promoted from Div Two: Durham and Worcestershire

Many of the changes in 2024 will be the undoing of alterations introduced for the 2023 season.

The five points for a draw experiment was short-lived, reverting back to eight, though batting and bowling bonus points stay the same as last year.

Traditionalists will probably welcome the fact that, by popular demand, County Championship matches will be played in every month of the season.

The campaign begins with eight consecutive rounds, played from Friday to Monday each week across April and May.

Following a break for T20 cricket, and before England men's Test summer, the season returns with back-to-back rounds in late June and early July.

After no Championship cricket in August last summer, two rounds take place towards the end of the month this year.

The first half of the month will again be reserved for The Hundred and One-Day Cup.

The final round of the Championship campaign starts on Thursday, 26 September.

While it is unlikely to be widespread, for the first time hybrid pitches will be permitted in a one-year ECB trial.

Hybrid tracks, which remain predominantly grass - but contain a small amount of synthetic fibres to help prevent deterioration and allow more cricket to be played on them - have previously only been used in white-ball cricket.

Another thing to look out for is the return of the Kookaburra ball in place of the Dukes ball, with the number of rounds in which it will be used doubling from two to four.

The ECB wants English players to be more experienced facing or bowling with it, with half an eye on the overseas Ashes series in 2025.

The Duke of Sussex unexpectedly appeared at the High Court as legal proceedings began over alleged phone-tapping and other breaches of privacy.

Prince Harry, who is one of those suing Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mail, was joined in the court room by singer Sir Elton John.

The duke claims ""suspicion and paranoia"" were caused by Associated's publication of some articles.

The publisher ""vigorously denies"" all the claims against it.

Prince Harry arrived at the High Court on Monday morning, while Sir Elton, who is also involved in the legal proceedings, joined proceedings at lunchtime.

Sir Elton John arrived at the High Court on Monday lunchtime

The pair, along with actresses Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley, are among the individuals who allege unlawful information gathering by the company, which also publishes the Mail on Sunday.

Others taking part in the legal action include Sir Elton's husband David Furnish, and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in a racist attack in 1993.

The four-day preliminary hearing in London is considering legal arguments and a judge will decide whether the case will go any further. Associated Newspapers (ANL) wants to end the claims without trial.

David Sherborne, the lawyer for the group of prominent individuals, said: ""The claimants each claim that in different ways they were the victim of numerous unlawful acts carried out by the defendant, or by those acting on the instructions of its newspapers, the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.""

He said the alleged unlawful activity included ""illegally intercepting voicemail messages; listening into live landline calls; obtaining private information, such as itemised phone bills or medical records, by deception or 'blagging'"".

The activity also allegedly included ""using private investigators to commit these unlawful information gathering acts on their behalf and even commissioning the breaking and entry into private property"".

He added: ""They range through a period from 1993 to 2011, even continuing beyond until 2018.""

Actress Sadie Frost also appeared on Monday, and sat two seats away from Harry in the courtroom

In a document filed on Prince Harry's behalf, Mr Sherborne said the duke was ""troubled that, through Associated's unlawful acts, he was largely deprived of important aspects of his teenage years"".

In particular, he said, the prince had ""suspicion and paranoia"" caused by the publication of articles by ANL using unlawfully gathered information.

The barrister said: ""Friends were lost or cut off as a result and everyone became a 'suspect' since he was misled by the way that the articles were written into believing that those close to him were the source of this information being provided to Associated's newspapers.""

He added: ""The claimant regards Associated's unlawful acts to amount to a major betrayal given promises made by the media to improve its conduct following the tragic and untimely death of his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997.""

Sir Elton's lawyer said the singer and his husband were ""appalled"" by ANL's alleged conduct

The High Court was told Sir Elton and Mr Furnish's landline at their home in Windsor was tapped by a private investigator on the instructions of Associated Newspapers Limited.

Mr Sherborne said they were ""mortified to consider all their conversations, some of which were very personal indeed, were tapped, taped, packaged and consumed as a commercial product for journalists and unknown others to pick over regardless of whether or not they were published"".

The High Court heard Sir Elton and Mr Furn"
9,"ish had not seen a copy of their first child's birth certificate before it was unlawfully obtained by ANL.

Baroness Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was murdered in a racist attack, also attended court on Monday

Mr Sherborne also told the court a private investigator acting on behalf of ANL hacked Hurley's phone and placed a ""sticky window mini-microphone"" outside her home.

He added her ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant's car was bugged to unlawfully obtain information about her finances, travel plans and medicals during her pregnancy.

He also told the court ANL paid a private investigator to unlawfully find the address of a man it believed was the male lover of Liberal Democrat politician Sir Simon Hughes.

Baroness Lawrence's bank accounts were monitored to check whether she was receiving any money from other newspapers during the Daily Mail's Justice for Stephen Lawrence Campaign, Mr Sherborne alleged.

""She finds it hard to believe the level of duplicity and manipulation that was clearly at play, knowing now as she does that the Daily Mail's outward support for her fight to bring Stephen's killers to justice was hollow and, worse, entirely false,"" he said.

ANL has said it categorically denies the serious claims made in the litigation and will vigorously defend them if necessary.

The group launched the legal action last year. ANL's lawyer Adrian Beltrami KC said, in written submissions, that the legal actions had been brought too late, were ""stale"" and the claims were ""largely inferential"".

The barrister said the individuals had to prove they did not know earlier, or could not have discovered earlier, they might have had a claim against ANL for alleged misuse of their private information.

He said none of the group said they believe they continued to be targeted by unlawful information-gathering after 2015.

In a statement after Monday's hearing, it added: ""A private investigator whose 'confessions' form a key element of a privacy case being brought against Associated Newspapers by Prince Harry, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, Elton John and others has denied their allegations that he acted illegally against them on behalf of the Daily Mail or Mail on Sunday.""

It said while the Mail's ""admiration of Baroness Lawrence remained undimmed"", we are ""profoundly saddened that she has been persuaded to bring this case"".

It added: ""The Mail remains hugely proud of its pivotal role in campaigning for justice for Stephen Lawrence. Its famous 'Murderers' front page triggered the Macpherson report.""

The Duke of Sussex was last seen in the UK at the late Queen's funeral

The duke's appearance on Monday is believed to be the first time he has been back in the UK since the late Queen's funeral in September.

His surprise return comes nearly three months after he publicised his troubled relationship with his father the King and brother the Prince of Wales in his controversial autobiography Spare.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex also released a Netflix documentary in December, titled Harry & Meghan.

The King was due to be away on Monday on the first official state visit of his reign, but the trip to France was cancelled due to rioting over pension reforms.

He is due to leave for a state visit to Germany on Wednesday morning.

Buckingham Palace said he was not in Windsor or London on Monday.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been asked to vacate their UK home, Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, in a move sanctioned by the King.

The duke is also taking legal action against the Home Office over security arrangements when he is in the UK, raising questions about his own security provisions during this visit.

Counting is continuing in local elections in Northern Ireland, with nearly half of the seats filled

So far, this has been a good day for Sinn Féin with most seats returned, followed by the DUP and then Alliance.

200 councillors out of 462 have been elected. A total of 807 people are competing for 462 seats in council chambers across Northern Ireland.

A total of 1,305,553 people were eligible to vote, according to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland.

With 200 councillors elected, nearly half of the seats were filled by 2100 on Friday

Sinn Féin has made breakthroughs with its first councillors elected in Lisburn City and Ballymena. In Foyle, the party appears to have recovered ground lost at the last election. Party vice-president Michelle O'Neill has described it as a very positive day.

The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said this election was always about holding ground but said that it was time to stop splitting the Unionist vote.

The Alliance Party became the third biggest at the NI Assembly election last May and so far it seems on track to replicate that in these council elections. The party has taken its first ever council seats in Ballyclare, Fermanagh and Limavady.

It will be hoping to increase its share of the vote West of the Bann but, while the party has made gains, it has also had a key loss in Londonderry.

The SDLP hopes to retain its 59 seats from the 2019 elections, but is under pressure from Sinn Féin.

The Ulster Unionist Party is also facing a battle to hold its ground but its leader Doug Beattie said Unionism was likely to take a hit across the board.

It has not been a good day for the Green Party. Their leader in Northern Ireland, Mal O'Hara, has lost his seat on Belfast City Council. Mr O'Hara became party leader last August after Clare Bailey lost her seat in the Stormont Assembly elections. The deputy leader of the party, Lesley Veronica, has also failed to get elected.

California's governor had blocked previous bids to release Leslie Van Houten (right)

Leslie Van Houten, a former follower of notorious cult leader Charles Manson, has been released on parole after serving more than five decades of a life sentence for two brutal murders.

Van Houten, 73, was a 19-year old member of the ""Manson family"" when she took part in the murder of a Los Angeles grocer and his wife in 1969.

Five previous bids for her parole were blocked by California's governors.

That decision was later reversed by a state appeals court.

A former homecoming queen, Van Houten was the youngest Manson follower to be convicted of murder for her role in the death of a California grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary.

During the killings - which took place just days after the murder of actress Sharon Tate and four others - Van Houten held down Rosemary LaBianca while someone else stabbed her. She later also admitted that she stabbed the woman after she was dead.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Van Houten's lawyer, Nancy Tetreault, told the BBC that she left a women's prison in California early on Tuesday morning and was likely to be on parole for three years.

""She had a long job of detaching herself from the cult mentality and accepting responsibility for her crimes"" Ms Tetreault said. ""It took her a long time. She had decades of therapy. So she felt guilt and deep remorse.""

Charles Manson, considered one of America's most notorious cult leaders, directed his followers to commit nine murders and hoped the killings would start a race war, called ""Helter Skelter"" after a famous song by the Beatles. He died in prison in 2017.

Following her life sentence, Van Houten earned both a bachelors and masters degree while in prison, where she also worked as a tutor for other inmates.

After being denied parole dozens of times during her incarceration, Van Houten was finally recommended for parole in 2016. But the recommendations were rejected by California Governor Gavin Newsom and his predecessor, Jerry Brown.

The last time she was blocked from parole, in 2020, was ultimately overruled by a California appeals court.

On 8 July, however, Mr Newsom said that he would not block her parole this time, paving the way for her release on Tuesday.

In a statement last week, the governor said he remained disappoint"
10,"ed at her release, which he said was unlikely to be heard by California's Supreme Court if the legal battle continued.

""More than 50 years after the Manson cult committed these brutal killings, the victims' families still feel the impact,"" the statement said.

Leslie Van Houten (right) was the youngest Manson follower to be convicted of murder for her role in the death of Leno LaBianca

Now out of prison, Van Houten is expected to spend about a year at a halfway house, where her lawyer said she would need to learn to navigate a reality much different to when she first was put behind bars.

""She has to learn to use the internet. She has to learn to buy things without cash,"" Ms Tetreault told the AP. ""It's a very different world than when she went in.""

In repeated parole hearings, Van Houten expressed regret for her role in the killings and involvement with Manson, later acknowledging that she had let him overpower her ""individual thinking"".

""I bought into it lock, stock and barrel,"" she said of his beliefs in a 2002 parole hearing. ""I took it at face value"".

Malcolm Myers says 10-year-old rescue dog Buddy is his hero

A man who was trapped under a fallen tree branch has said his life was saved by his dog.

Malcolm Myers, from Thirsk, was walking his rescue dog Buddy on a footpath when he heard a loud crack.

A branch from a horse chestnut tree hit him on the back and head, burying him - but he said Buddy dug away the foliage to help free him.

North Yorkshire Council said it had contacted the landowner and had launched an investigation.

Mr Myers, 63, was walking on a path near Thirsk and Sowerby Institute on 7 June at around 13:45 BST when he said he heard a sound like a ""clap of thunder"".

""I was buried with a tree that had fallen on top of me, I was trapped, I couldn't move,"" he said.

""There was a branch around my leg. It was sheer darkness, I couldn't see anything. I was really fearful for my life at this point.""

North Yorkshire Council has launched an investigation after the branch fell on to a footpath

He said he could hear people screaming, but his terrier-chihuahua cross Buddy ""frantically started digging"" at the foliage.

""I remember saying to him, 'keep digging Bud'. I put my hand out to his paw and then he gave me the strength to fight to get out.""

Mr Myers said he suffered a trauma injury and concussion as a result of being hit by the fallen branch, leaving him ""mentally and physically totally wrecked"".

""All I can say is that he's my little hero, without Buddy by my side I would have died.""

Buddy helped dig his owner out from underneath the fallen tree

He is now calling for the council to do more to inspect older trees that could be at risk of falling on passers-by.

The tree, which is on private property, has a tree protection order on it.

North Yorkshire Council's interim head of highway operations, Jayne Charlton, said the authority was investigating the situation.""A member of the public alerted us to the incident, which we responded to immediately, closing the footpath while the debris was cleared,"" she said.""We received a further report that a man walking his dog was hit on the back by a large branch, while a smaller one struck him on the head.""We have made contact with the landowner to inform them of their responsibilities with regard to the tree, which is subject to a tree preservation order.""

Chelsea have it all to do if they are to advance to the Champions League semi-finals after losing to holders Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.

Karim Benzema's tap-in - his 90th goal in the competition - gave Real boss Carlo Ancelotti the perfect start against his former club.

Real Madrid struggled to add to their lead before Ben Chilwell was shown a straight red card in the 59th minute for fouling Rodrygo as the Brazil forward threatened to go clean through on goal.

Chelsea produced a battling performance but Real scored what could be a decisive second goal when substitute Marco Asensio finished well after the visitors were caught out following a short corner.

Chelsea carried more of an attacking threat after the tepid performance against Wolves in Frank Lampard's first game back as interim manager, and had chances of their own.

Joao Felix forced Thibaut Courtois into a smart save when the game was goalless before the former Chelsea keeper produced a fine diving stop to deny Raheem Sterling an equaliser.
• None Check out all the latest Chelsea news in one place

Chelsea must score at least twice in next Tuesday's quarter-final return leg at Stamford Bridge, but they are now without a goal in their past four matches.

They were denied a late strike when former Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger produced a superb block to deny substitute Mason Mount a goal that would have sent the Blues into the second leg in high spirits.

The Champions League is their last hope of a trophy in this most chaotic of seasons and Felix almost gave the Blues a dream start in the second minute, only to be denied by Courtois.

While Real struggled at times for rhythm in midfield, the return of N'Golo Kante improved Chelsea's engine room, while Felix continued to keep Courtois on his toes before he was replaced after Chilwell was sent off in the 59th minute.

Chelsea owner Todd Boehly said in an interview with Sky Sports before the game that ""we're excited about the future"" while also predicting his club would win 3-0 against Real Madrid.

It is hard to see where the excitement is coming from after a fifth game without a win and the team drifting in the bottom half of the Premier League table.

This was Chelsea's ninth Champions League game of the season with their third different manager.

Since Ancelotti was sacked by the Blues in May 2011 after finishing second in the table, Chelsea have gone through 10 permanent managers - sacking seven, including Lampard in January 2021.

Lampard had been due to work at this game as a television pundit until he answered Chelsea's call to take charge until the end of the season.

The club legend, however, has now suffered 13 defeats in his past 16 matches in all competitions across spells with Everton and Chelsea this season.

Ancelotti said on the eve of this tie that he was ""sad"" about Chelsea's poor form yet his Real Madrid side added to his former club's problems.

Real were far from their fluid best but did enough to establish a healthy advantage as they look to win the competition for a record 15th time.

Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo were a handful as Real registered 18 attempts, while Courtois was a solid last line of defence.

Rudiger's block to deny Mount at the end was crucial. Having helped Chelsea win the Champions League in 2021, the German showed what a shrewd addition he is after moving to Real on a free transfer last June.

Time is running out if the police and the government are to restore public trust in policing, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary has warned.

In his annual report, Andy Cooke said police forces were experiencing ""one of their biggest crises in living memory"".

""Atrocious"" crimes committed by serving police officers had fuelled distrust, while too few criminals were being caught, he added.

Mr Cooke has called for new powers to enforce improvements.

In his annual assessment of policing in England and Wales, Mr Cooke's first since his appointment last year, he said police were failing to keep up with rising demand from the public and too often were not doing the basics right.

Charge rates had fallen by two-thirds since 2014, the report stated, while victims were increasingly dissatisfied with the police and wider criminal justice system.

""I can't recall a time when the relationship between the police and the public was more strained than it is now,"" Mr Cooke said.

""The public expectation of policing is that they prevent crime, they investigate crime properly, that they're in the communities, they're visible, that they answer 999 calls quickly. These are all the basics of policing.

""We've seen too many occasions where opportunities are being missed to catch offenders who are causing misery in our communities.""

Mr Cooke says the police are often ""picking up the slack"" for other parts of public services.

""Mental health is a great example,"" he said. ""Last year policing attended 600,000 mental health incidents. Most of those incidents there was no requirement for police to attend.""

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley wrote to health and social care services in Greater London in May, informing them the service would stop attending mental health incidents from September, except where there is an ""immediate threat to life"".

Humberside Police introduced the Right Care, Right Person scheme in 2020 to ensure mental health calls are dealt with by relevant professionals.

Mr Cooke welcomed investment that had seen more than 20,000 police officers added in England and Wales since 2020.

However, he noted difficulties in vetting new recruits and the inexperience of a workforce which lost many established officers during David Cameron's time as prime minister.

Furthermore, where failings have been identified, some forces have been too slow to implement improvements, he said.

Mr Cooke called on Home Secretary Suella Braverman to grant new enforcement powers to enforce compliance with the Inspectorate of Constabulary's recommendations by the end of this year.

Forces had taken too long to respond to recommendations in the 2016 State of Policing report relating to officers abusing their positions for sexual purposes, he said.

""Two forces did from the start what they should have done,"" Mr Cooke said. ""That should have been 43 forces.

""In those seven years, we have seen some truly horrendous acts by officers.

""The chances of these things happening would have been lessened had we had those powers at an earlier time.

""It would ensure police chiefs across the country would have to make the changes that are required to keep the public safe.""

Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called the report ""truly damning"" and backed major reforms. She blamed successive Conservative home secretaries for a series of failings.

""These include systemic failings in policing and a totally dysfunctional criminal justice system, with more criminals getting away with crimes, victims let down, vital neighbourhood policing devastated, record numbers of forces in special measures, and confidence in policing falling,"" she said.

Ms Braverman said the report acknowledged a fall in crime rates but conceded ""there is lots more to do"".

She added: ""This is why I've been calling for common-sense policing. With the highest number of police officers than ever before, the police must deliver for victims.

""It has always been my priority to reduce burdens on policing and ensure they have the resources they need.""

Baroness Louise Casey, who authored a damning report on the Met earlier this year, told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that for people to consent to policing, officers need to be seen as ""beyond reproach"" on issues like violence against women.

She said: ""The thing I still feel is fairly unforgivable is that misconduct in a police officer is totally undermining of the fact that they can arrest me, they can cuff me, they can strip search me, they can literally take my clothes off and strip search me.

""They can put me in a police cell for 24 hours, all on the basis of that officer's word.""

Members of the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives have voted to accept a new pay offer from the Scottish government.

The unions had recommended its members back the deal which would see a 6.5% increase from April.

On top of a 7.5% pay rise imposed for 2022/23, it means many staff will see their pay increase by 13-14% over two years.

The votes to accept the offer ends the immediate threat of strike action.

It comes after members of GMB Scotland, the union representing NHS and ambulance staff, accepted the offer last week.

All three unions had mandates to strike after rejecting the 2022/23 pay offer but they were suspended in January ahead of intensive negotiations over the 2023/24 pay deal.

The new deal also includes the commitment to modernising the Agenda for Change pay system, and to support workforce recruitment, sustainability and retention.

The Scottish government has previously said the offer would make Scotland's NHS staff by far the best paid in the UK.

The RCN confirmed just over 50% of eligible members took part in the consultative ballot with 53.4% voting to accept the offer.

Among RCM members, 44% took part in the ballot, with 69% voting to accept the deal

Announcing the result of the ballot, RCN director Colin Poolman praised the union's members for bringing the Scottish government back to the table. He added: ""Members have narrowly voted to accept this offer but the Scottish government must be under no illusion, much more is required for nursing staff to feel valued and to ensure Scotland has the nursing workforce it needs.""

A new pay offer was made to staff including ambulance workers

Julie Lamberth, chair of the union's Scotland board said it took ""the real threat"" of nursing strikes to secure the offer.

She added: ""While members voted by a narrow margin to accept the offer, the chronic staff shortages and low morale that led to the strike mandate are still very real.""

Jaki Lambert, RCM director for Scotland, added: ""While pay is crucial this was also about midwives feeling seen and valued. Improving retention through better working conditions, professional midwifery issues and the wellbeing of staff are also a key component of this.

""Most importantly, it was also about our members standing tall and being prepared to take action to ensure better care for women, babies, and their families.""

The Scottish government said it had committed an extra £568m to the 2023/24 offer to 160,000 NHS Scotland workers on Agenda for Change contracts - who includes nurses, paramedics, midwives and porters.

Staff up to Band 8a would see an uplift of at least 6.5%.

In addition, all staff would receive a one-off payment between £387 and £939 depending on band"
12,"ing.

Nurses protest during a strike by NHS medical workers outside University College London Hospital in London

Meanwhile, in England a 5% pay rise from April has been offered to NHS staff including nurses and ambulance workers.

In addition, staff have been offered a one-off payment of at least £1,655 to top up the past year's pay award.

Unions are recommending members back the deal, after nearly two weeks of talks with ministers, raising hopes the bitter dispute may be coming to an end.

The offer covers all NHS staff except doctors, who are on a different contract.

It comes after a winter of industrial action, with nurses, ambulance staff and physios all striking.

The unions put further action on hold, after the two sides agreed to discussions last month.

Jason, six-months old, is currently up for adoption at All Dogs Matter

Illegal imports of puppies have continued to thrive following the pandemic, a study into UK purchasing practices suggests.

The Royal Veterinary College says the rise means dogs are at risk of being exposed to infectious diseases and a ""very impoverished environment"".

The report highlights other irresponsible practices from breeders such as only offering online viewings.

The government said buyers must go to a reputable seller or rehoming centre.

The rise in puppy smuggling came amid a surge in demand for puppies during the coronavirus lockdowns, with prices in some areas more than doubling to an average of almost £1,900 each.

In a study published on Thursday in the journal Animals and shared with the BBC, the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) highlighted trends in puppy purchasing across the UK.

Dr Rowena Packer, first author of the study, said the rise in imported puppies was concerning.

The study estimates 10% of puppies purchased in 2021 were imported, more than double the figure from 2019.

Babaloo's owner, Ms Papantoni, describes her as ""a very lovely, happy, energetic, kind, sensitive, and a bit of a naughty dog""

In December 2020, Vasiliki Papantoni, in London, legally imported a puppy from Serbia after carefully planning the dog's journey to the UK.

She said the breeder had a ""good reference"" from a friend and provided lots of paperwork.

Ms Papantoni said she started her search for a puppy in the UK, but found that waiting lists were ""very long"".

She said a previous attempt to purchase a puppy in the UK ended in her being ""scammed"" when a breeder stopped contact after receiving a £300 deposit.

Dr Packer warns not all imported puppies receive good care when taken across Europe. ""These could be puppies that were transported for several days without appropriate provisions, rest, food, water,"" she said.

The RVC say puppies brought into the UK are ""often under the minimum legal age"" of 15 weeks, unlike Babaloo.

The organisation asked UK puppy purchasers the same questions over three years via an online survey. They analysed 1,148 responses from 2019, 4,369 from 2020 and 2,080 from 2021.

Dr Packer warns ""poor welfare sources"" also exist within the UK, such as ""a breeder or a dealer or somebody who produces puppies without due regard to their health and welfare"".

""You can very rapidly and cheaply rear a puppy if you don't care about some of those factors,"" she said.

Introduced in April 2020, 'Lucy's Law' requires puppies bred in England be shown with their mother and purchased from the place they were born.

The law does not apply to rescue and rehoming organisations, Defra said.

Dr Marc Abraham OBE, a vet, founded the campaign. He calls it a ""first step in combating irresponsible breeding and selling practices"".

But he adds it was overshadowed by the pandemic.

Ira Moss, founder of charity All Dogs Matter, says she knows of multiple puppy purchasers who were only shown pictures of the dog's parents, or were not allowed into the property where they were said to have been born.

The RVC's study estimates people purchasing puppies in 2021 ""were more likely to rely on online viewings, rather than in person, and to collect the puppy from outside the breeder's property"".

In 2019, only 7% of respondents viewed the puppy they purchased via a live video call. In 2021, the figure was 18%.

The pandemic restrictions still in effect for parts of 2021 may have factored into that year's figure.

Dr Abraham says the pandemic also led to a ""huge surge in demand"" for dogs, pushing up the price for a puppy and leading to more first time owners.

He adds: ""There's so many inexperienced dog owners around that I'm not not sure people did enough investment in how to look after a dog.""

In turn, he warns this has led to a ""spike in dogs being abandoned"".

In October 2022, RSPCA data showed the charity had seen a 25% rise in abandonment cases.

All Dogs Matter says the rescue sector now faces a ""rehoming crisis"". Ms Moss explains ""there are too many dogs, not enough spaces"".

Furthermore, the cost of living crisis means ""charities are losing money with less donations coming in"".

Dr Abraham says ""rescue shelters have rules for a reason"".

""Please don't think…if they say no, that you should then go online and have a puppy delivered,"" he added.

A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: ""Buyers must do their research and ensure they go to a reputable seller or rehoming centre when looking for a pet.

""We are committed to delivering the Kept Animals Bill measures individually, including on puppy smuggling, during the remainder of this Parliament and look forward to progressing these. We will be setting out next steps in due course.""

Oil prices have risen after Saudi Arabia said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day (bpd) in July.

Other members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices.

Opec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices.

In Asia trade on Monday, Brent crude oil rose by as much as 2.4% before settling at around $77 a barrel.

Opec+ said production targets would drop by a further 1.4 million bpd from 2024.

The seven hour-long meeting on Sunday of the oil-rich nations came against a backdrop of falling energy prices.

Oil prices soared when Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but are now back at levels seen before the conflict began.

In October last year Opec+, a formulation which refers to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, agreed to cut production by two million bpd, about 2% of global demand.

In April this year the group agreed to a further cuts, which were due to last to the end of this year. But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Sunday's talks led to ""the extension of the deal until the end of 2024"".

On Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that his country's cut of one million bpd could be extended beyond July if needed. ""This is a Saudi lollipop,"" he said, in what is seen as a bid to stabilise the market.

Before the two-day Opec+ meeting started, it was widely expected the oil cartel would make production cuts to prop up prices. It appears most members were against the idea, as any cuts would impact oil revenues, which are crucial to keep running their economies.

Saudi Arabia's decision to make a voluntary reduction of one-million barrels per day was unexpected but does not come as a huge surprise. As the leader of the pack, and also the largest exporter of oil, it was the only one in a position to be able to lower output.

From Riyadh's point"
13,"of view, it is crucial the price of crude remains over $80 a barrel for it to break even. Saudi officials want elevated prices to keep spending billions of dollars on ambitious projects spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as he tries to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil.

The move by the Saudis also underlines the uncertain outlook for demand for fuels in the months to come. Concerns about the global economy, especially recessionary fears in the US and Europe are expected to put further pressure on crude prices.

Oil producers are grappling with falling prices and high market volatility amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices and undermining the global economy through high energy costs. It has also accused the group of siding with Russia despite sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.

In response, Opec insiders have said the West's monetary policy over the last decade has driven inflation and forced oil-producing nations to act to maintain the value of their main export.

The crossing forms part of the Strathspey Railway

Safety barriers have been installed at the last automatic open railway level crossing in Scotland.

Dalfaber Level Crossing in Aviemore was built in the early 1980s and is on a private line used by Strathspey Railway's steam locomotives.

It was an open crossing with warning signs and lights but no barriers before the new improvements were made.

New footways have also been constructed as part of the £1.1m upgrade to improve safety at the site.

The crossing has been the scene of collisions and near misses involving cars and trains - including an incident in March last year.

P﻿olice Scotland previously warned of motorists failing to stop as trains approached the crossing.

The work is a condition of Scotia Homes' planning approval to build 75 new homes on a nearby site.

Access to the new development involves using the crossing.

Scotia Homes worked with Strathspey Railway and Highland Council on the upgrade.

S﻿trathspey Railway has been operating steam locomotives for 40 years.

Andy Murray dazzled under the Wimbledon lights again as he led Greek fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in a Centre Court thriller stopped by a 23:00 BST curfew.

Britain's Murray is ranked 40th but showed his pedigree on the SW19 grass to lead 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-2) 6-4.

The second-round match was stopped at 22:39 because of the restrictions put in place by the local council.

Murray, who has regularly played late in recent years, and Tsitsipas will resume a captivating contest on Friday.

Moments after 36-year-old Murray had wrapped up the third set, tournament referee Gerry Armstrong walked on to the court and discussed stopping play for the night with each player.

Murray, who screamed out as he fell just before serving out for the lead, signalled to his team the match was being cut short, while 24-year-old Tsitsipas quickly packed his bags.

The pair will return to Centre Court after Spanish top seed Carlos Alcaraz plays France's Alexandre Muller in the first match, which starts at 13:30.
• None Djokovic set for 'duel of the veterans of the tour'

Eyes were instantly drawn to this potential blockbuster when the draw was made last Friday and, after both players negotiated their opening matches on different paths, it was billed as the box-office match of the tournament so far.

Further fuel was added by the memories from their feisty clash at the 2021 US Open, where Murray said he ""lost respect"" for Tsitsipas after a lengthy bathroom break before a final set which the Greek won.

This time, all the drama remained on the court.

Murray is a two-time champion at the All England Club and has been talking bullishly about his chances of going deep in the draw this fortnight.

Despite missing out on a seeding, which left him vulnerable to a tough early test, the former world number one insisted he had the ability and nous to cause anyone problems.

For many people, Tsitsipas felt ripe to be on the end of an upset.

With grass not his favourite surface and a patchy record on the surface this year, there was an optimism among the home fans that Murray could earn his most notable Grand Slam win since having career-saving hip surgery in 2019.

After cruising past Ryan Peniston on Tuesday, the Scot also had the benefit of a day off, while Tsitsipas only came through a five-set duel with Dominic Thiem at almost 20:00 on Wednesday.

But the 2021 French Open runner-up and 2023 Australian Open finalist looked sharp - physically and mentally - as he showed glimpses of the form which has seen him long tipped to win one of the sport's four major titles.

There were tense moments in a tight first set where both players dominated on serve, Tsitsipas taking control of the tie-break to move ahead.

The second set followed a similar pattern.

Tsitsipas was edging the rallies as he continued to find range with his forehand, leaving Murray struggling to cope with his ferocious and consistent hitting from that side.

But, like he has done so often over the years, Murray continued to battle and managed to hold his service games with few issues as neither player conceded a break point.

That teed up another tie-break - and this time it was Murray who dominated it after finding his first serve when it mattered.

Murray playing under the floodlights on Centre Court always creates a special atmosphere and the player, by now demanding more noise from the almost-capacity crowd, thrived on the energy.

After not having a serious look at Tsitsipas's serve in the opening two sets, Murray broke to love right at the start of the third and maintained the momentum to move into the lead.

However, there was a serious scare when he fell on the baseline.

The sound of his scream, along with the knowledge of his injury history, left the whole of Centre Court anxious and there was relief when he clambered to his feet before serving out.

It had long felt the end of the third set was the natural point to suspend the match and once that was agreed, Murray walked off to a thunderous ovation.

Thursday's blast damaged a number of buildings - it's not known if the explosive found on Saturday was from the same aircraft

More than 3,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in the Russian city of Belgorod after an undetonated explosive was found.

It comes two days after Russia accidentally dropped a bomb on the same city, damaging houses and injuring several people.

It's not known if the bomb discovered on Saturday came from the same aircraft - a Russian Sukhoi-34 fighter-jet.

The city is located about 40km (25 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, confirmed on Telegram that 17 apartment buildings had to be cordoned off ""within a radius of 200 metres"", affecting 3,000 residents.

He later said people were starting to return to their homes after a ""shell"" had been removed.

The undetonated device was found in the same area as the bomb that was accidentally dropped on Thursday evening, leaving a huge crater about 20 metres (60 ft) wide close to the city centre.

The explosion was so large it blew a car on to the roof of a nearby shop.

After that incident, the Russian defence ministry admitted that one of its Su-34 jets had ""accidentally discharged aircraft ordnance"" over the city.

Dramatic CCTV footage of Thursday's blast shows an object landing near a crossroads with passing cars, and detonating about 18 seconds later.

It's not the first such incident - last October a Sukhoi fighter-jet - again, an Su-34 - crashed in the Russian city of Yeysk killing at least 13 people.

Russian jets regularly fly over Belgorod, a city of 370,000, on their way to Ukraine.

It lies just north of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, and has come under periodic Ukrainian attack since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.

President Joe Biden's call for a ceasefire in Gaza is the lead in the Guardian and the Telegraph. The Guardian's headline describes it as America's ""strongest rebuke"" yet to Israel since the start of the conflict. The Daily Telegraph quotes a confidante of President Biden as saying that the US is ""at that point"" where it must consider putting conditions on arms sales to Israel.

The i reports that the prime minister is being urged to publish legal advice received by the government on arm sales. It says Rishi Sunak is preparing to suspend the sales to Israel if new guidance suggests the country has broken international law. The i also says that civil servants, who are overseeing the export of arms to Israel, are threatening legal action against the government over concerns they will be held ""personally responsible"" for any breach of the law. Israel strongly rejects the claim it is responsible for genocide in Gaza.

President Biden said ongoing US support for Israel was dependent on ""specific, concrete steps""

Both the Times and the Daily Mail lead with stories about Conservative MP William Wragg, who has said to have admitted handing over colleagues' phone numbers to a man he met on a dating app. Speaking to the Times, Mr Wragg said he was scared that the man ""had compromising things"" on him and said he was ""so sorry"" his weakness had hurt other people. The paper says the incident has ""heightened"" concerns over the vulnerability of MPs to cyber-attacks.

The Daily Telegraph carries a warning from French President Emmanuel Macron that Russia will seek to disrupt the Paris Olympics this summer. It reports that Mr Macron told Nato foreign ministers about a ""bizarre and threatening"" phone call between Russia's defence minister and his French counterpart. Sergei Shoigu is said to have ""suggested"", without evidence, that France was involved in the recent attack on a Moscow concert hall. Asked whether he was concerned that Russia may target the Games this summer, Mr Macron reportedly replied: ""I have no doubt.""

William Wragg told the Times: ""They had compromising things on me. They wouldn't leave me alone.""

The Sun carries a photo of King Charles and Queen Camilla during their visit to Australia in 2018 on its front page. The paper reports that the couple are planning a two-week return visit in October, after what it calls a ""positive"" start to the King's treatment for cancer.

The Daily Express reports that every ""loophole"" is being closed to foil any attempt at blocking migrant flights to Rwanda. It says a source close to Home Secretary James Cleverly has confirmed there's been a real ""step up"" in preparations to deliver on the deportation scheme since Easter.

A couple who won £2.7m in the lottery in 1995 are featured in the Daily Mirror. Elaine and Derek Thompson, who are big horseracing fans, used their winnings to buy three racehorses and set themselves the challenge of visiting all 57 racecourses in the UK. The paper says that this week they passed the finishing post after making their final trip to Ludlow in Shropshire. ""National Trottery"" is the headline.

Glory day: David Trimble, Bono and John Hume pictured together on stage in Belfast in 1998

It was the night that produced the defining image of Northern Ireland's progress to peace.

To one side, the then Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble. On the other, the then SDLP leader John Hume.

The man in between, holding their hands aloft like triumphant prize fighters, was the world's biggest rock star - Bono.

The Concert for Yes, which took place on 18 May 1998 in front of about 2,000 schoolchildren, achieved its aim.

Three days later, Northern Ireland overwhelmingly endorsed the Good Friday Agreement in a referendum.

Tim Wheeler, lead singer of County Down band Ash, had a stage-side view of the historic moment - but his memories of the night are not quite so romantic.

Instead, he remembers putting together songs on the fly and loaning guitars and equipment to the biggest band on the planet.

""U2 just flew in before the whole thing and they didn't bring any of their gear, they had to use all our gear,"" Wheeler told BBC News NI's The Sunday News.

He recalled how The Edge from U2 had borrowed a guitar belonging to Charlotte Hatherley, Ash's then lead guitarist.

""He was trying to figure out the controls. He was trying to get more of a louder kind of sound and he stepped on one of her pedals and it was too huge a jump - and he sort of jumped. It was pretty funny.""

They may have been overshadowed by Bono et al, but it was Ash who did most of the on-stage heavy lifting on the night, delivering a 40-minute set and then performing a few hastily-arranged covers with U2.

At the time, the young Downpatrick band were riding an upsurge of rising hype and popularity - their debut album, 1977, was a critical and commercial success, buoyed by heavy radio rotations for singles such as Girl from Mars and Oh Yeah.

Charlotte Hatherley, Rick McMurray and Tim Wheeler from Ash in 2002

Wheeler and co were in the studio recording the follow-up when they got the call - would they like to get involved in a concert campaigning for a yes vote?

""It all came about within a few days as far as I remember. I think it was just looking quite dicey whether the yes campaign would succeed.

""I think it was maybe U2's management got in touch with our management a few days before. We were in the a studio in London and they were like: 'Can you make it over to Belfast in three days time?'

""It was very important for us to be involved. I think U2 felt they needed a Northern Ireland band to make the concert really work - it was great.""

Wheeler, who was 21 at the time, added with a laugh: ""U2 were a massive, worldwide, legendary band from the south and they needed some youngsters from the north - it was a really good pairing, I think.""

The free concert for young people was envisioned as a last push to help get the yes vote over the line in the week of the referendum.

While a huge turnout of Northern Ireland voters would comfortably vote the agreement through by 71% to 29%, the security of a ""yes"" vote was less certain beforehand.

Catholics were expected to strongly support the agreement, but the deal needed cross-community backing and a solid majority to go ahead.

As the Washington Post reported at the time, David Trimble had his concerns.

""Over 70% we're safe. Under 60%, we're in difficulties. In between, you've got to look carefully at turnout, geographical variations to try to get an idea if we've got a secure enough base to proceed.""

Just three days and a couple of phone calls with Bono later, Ash were on stage at the concert in Belfast's Waterfront.

""Everything was last minute,"" said Wheeler.

""I remember being on the tour bus driving there the night before - I think we were put on a mobile phone with Bono, trying to figure out what songs we'd do together and how the show would go.""

It was decided that Ash would play their own show, with U2 coming on at the end to do a few numbers with an assist from the local lads, including covers of The Beatles' Don't Let Me Down and John Lennon's Give Peace a Chance.

According to Wheeler, Bono"
15,"was ""brilliant"" although he did throw him for a loop by calling for a Ben E King classic.

""Towards the end, Bono just turned round and said 'let's do Stand By Me'. He just pulled that out of thin air, no warning whatsoever.

""It's four very simple chords, we just started winging it and then he just looked at me and said: 'You sing the next verse'.

""I was like, I have no idea what the lyrics are at all, so I said 'you just do it'.""

Despite these understandable hiccups, the concert was a major success and, of course, produced that iconic image.

Tim Wheeler says Belfast was ""a very different place to grow up""

Wheeler remembered ""a great feeling of positivity"" after the concert that resonated with a band whose three founding members had lived all their lives under the shadow of the Troubles.

""Coming to Belfast always felt very edgy. The Army was everywhere, of course, and always bomb threats and incidents in our town.

""I do remember I was up in Belfast and saw a policeman had just been shot and was being covered in a body bag.

""Being children you just get on with it and think it's normal. And when we started travelling the world you realise it was a very different place to grow up.""

Two decades on from that night, and the 1998 agreement referendum, devolved government in Northern Ireland is out of action.

It is a ""very sad"" situation, said Wheeler, but ""at least we're living in a time that's a lot more peaceful"".

Maybe another star-studded night at the Waterfront could help?

""I wonder! he said with a laugh. ""Yeah, get it together - if a concert could work in a same way for that, we need to sit down and sort it out.""

You can hear the full interview with Ash's Tim Wheeler on The Sunday News at 13:00 GMT on Sunday.

The crash caused damage to the road's barrier

A lorry was left hanging off a bridge after crashing into a barrier on the M1 in Leicestershire.

Police were called to reports the vehicle had crashed on the southbound carriageway at junction 19 Catthorpe Interchange just after 04:30 BST.

The southbound carriageway was closed at junction 19 as well as both sides of the A14 while the vehicle was removed. Both roads have since reopened.

The driver safely left his vehicle and was not injured, police said.

In a statement, Leicestershire Police said the lorry had ""collided with the barrier leaving part of the vehicle and the barrier resting over the edge of the carriageway"".

National Highways thanked motorists for their patience during the lengthy road closures.

The lorry has since been recovered

No-one was injured in the crash

Melissa Caddick went missing in 2020 after police agents raided her home

When conwoman Melissa Caddick vanished from her luxurious eastern Sydney home in November 2020 - with only her partially decomposed foot found washed up on a beach months later - it set off a frenzy in Australia.

The case blindsided investors, baffled police, and captured the imagination of a nation.

The fraudster has inspired a hit podcast, a TV dramatisation, and countless outlandish theories - including that she had been swallowed by a shark or had severed her own foot to throw police off her scent.

A long-running inquest into the case heard of a flawed police investigation, conflicting accounts from her husband, and all the extensive speculation surrounding her fate.

But a coroner on Thursday ruled that exactly what happened to her would remain a mystery.

""The conclusion I have reached is that Melissa Caddick is deceased. However... I do not consider the evidence enables a positive finding as to how she died, or when and where this happened,"" Deputy State Coroner Elizabeth Ryan wrote.

For most, the Melissa Caddick story began with the news that the seemingly successful financial adviser was missing.

But her life had actually begun to unravel months earlier when Australia's financial watchdog was tipped off that she had been using a friend's financial adviser's licence, having simply pasted in her own name on the document.

Regulators suspect the 49-year-old stole up to $30m (£15.8m; $19.5m) from more than 60 clients, including many of her family and friends, to help fund a lavish lifestyle.

There were overseas trips on private jets, high-end cars, designer clothes, and expensive jewellery.

Her methods were not ""particularly complicated"", the coroner said.

As new clients gave her money to invest, she would pay some out as dividends to existing clients before keeping - and spending - the rest.

Coroner Ryan said she was struck by the ""powerful impression of wealth and success"" Caddick made on her clients and would-be investors.

""Equally significant was the trust they had in her... almost all were either immediate family members, or close personal friends of herself and her family,"" she said.

One would-be investor recalled: ""I wanted to model myself and our family on successful people, and Melissa appeared to be successful"".

But everything fell apart on 11 November 2020 when police knocked on her door at dawn.

The last confirmed sighting of Melissa Caddick was by officers at the raid on her home.

Her husband, Anthony Koletti, told police they believed she had gone for an early run the next morning. Her car and all her personal belongings had been left behind.

But she was not reported missing by Mr Koletti for more than 30 hours, and only after he had dialled in to a court hearing that she was due to attend and appeared surprised she had not turned up.

Police initially explored two theories - that Caddick was still alive and had gone into hiding to escape justice, or had taken her own life.

But the inquest heard how Mr Koletti, a hairdresser and part-time DJ, behaved erratically in the wake of his wife's disappearance, leading police to suspect he could be involved.

Mr Koletti has denied any knowledge of his wife's crimes or any involvement in her disappearance, and police say they have uncovered no evidence to dispute that.

Anthony Koletti has denied any knowledge of his wife's crimes

But an investigator told the coroner's court Mr Koletti ""didn't appear to be overly concerned"" when his wife vanished.

Lead Detective Sergeant Michael Kyneur also said Mr Koletti had visited a cliff top area near their home and taken a photograph of a shoe print, an action the policeman described as ""extraordinary"".

""That's a dog park. It's like saying I found a footprint on Bondi beach.""

The inquest also heard that Mr Koletti had sent texts from Caddick's phone pretending to be her, told police he was ""too busy"" to attend an interview, and gave conflicting versions of events.

For example, he was able to provide a description of what his wife was wearing on the morning she vanished, despite also saying he had not actually seen her, police said.

Mr Koletti had also recounted his version of events by releasing a musical concept album containing tracks with titles such as ""Melissa Is Missing"" and ""Above the Law"".

It was ""regrettable"" that Mr Koletti had not given a ""full and frank"" account of what had happened, Magistrate Ryan said on Thursday.

The case took a grisly twist in February 2021 with the discovery of a rotting, trainer-clad foot on a remote beach 500km (310 miles) south of Sydney.

Experts matched the body part to Caddick through DNA, but an autopsy couldn't determine if it was separated by force or decomposition.

The inquest heard a slew of theories to explain how it ended at Bournda"
16,"Beach, including that a shark ate and later regurgitated body parts.

Police even considered throwing pig carcasses with running shoes on their trotters into the sea to determine how shark behaviour or ocean currents could have played a role, the inquest heard.

An orthopaedic surgeon told the inquest it was unlikely Caddick could have severed her own foot, as it would require ""significant force"" to cut through bone, cause major blood loss, and require specialist post-surgical care.

But scientists put forward a simple explanation at the inquest.

Oceanographers said currents could have easily carried the foot that distance, while a pathologist described how human feet can detach from bodies during decomposition.

The inquest also heard criticism of police handling of the case.

Officers assigned to the Caddick case stuck too closely to their view that she had voluntarily vanished, some said.

Police combed the cliffs in Dover Heights for any trace of Ms Caddick

A crime scene examination of the house was not done until 19 days after Caddick disappeared, and a lawyer assisting the coroner questioned why the homicide squad wasn't brought in immediately, if only to rule out foul play.

Another detective expressed surprise that NSW Police only sought out the corporate watchdog's affidavit on Caddick - which outlined its case against her - some months after her disappearance.

The inquest was also told that Caddick had a life insurance policy, which included suicide cover, and had made a number of references to ending her life over the years - but police initially devoted limited resources to this line of inquiry.

Magistrate Ryan on Thursday said the uncovering of Caddick's deception may have triggered a ""narcissistic injury"", with the illusion of her wealth and success shattered.

""The Asic investigation and search warrant very likely caused her a catastrophic level of shame and despair,"" she said.

""She may well have reached the conclusion that ending her life was the only option.""

But the manner of her death will ultimately remain unresolved, she said.

Equally unresolved are the losses of her clients, many of whom saw huge sums of money vanish.

""I sold my business as I was under the impression my money was safe, and I retired in 2017,"" one victim testified.

""To rub more salt in the wound she has also stolen my mother's money, wife's, mother-in-law, son, brother and sister… wiping out three generations of my family's savings.""

Kate Forbes, who finished second to Humza Yousaf in the SNP leadership race, has announced that she is leaving the Scottish government.

Scotland's finance secretary was on maternity leave after the birth of her daughter when Nicola Sturgeon suddenly announced that she was quitting as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister.

Within a couple of days of confirming she would be standing in the contest to succeed her, Ms Forbes found herself at the centre of a political storm.

Her views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, trans rights and having children outside of marriage were savaged by Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who had been standing in for the deeply religious Ms Forbes since last July.

Ms Sturgeon herself also made thinly-veiled barbs at the woman she had appointed finance secretary at the age of 29, just hours before she had to deliver a budget speech.

Scotland is a progressive country, Ms Sturgeon stated, and the views of the next first minister therefore matter.

Ms Forbes saw several supporters desert her campaign in response to the furore, which was ignited when she told journalists that she would not have voted for gay marriage had she been an MSP at the time.

She subsequently told Sky News that she believed that having children outside of marriage is ""wrong"" according to her faith as a member of the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, while stressing that: ""In a free society you can do what you want.""

Ms Forbes has never hidden her religious beliefs, leaving pundits wondering why they had appeared to come as a shock to some of her supporters.

The Free Church, of which she is a devout follower, has strongly opposed gay marriage since it was legalised in Scotland in 2014.

Ms Forbes and her husband Ali celebrated the birth of daughter Naomi last year

In 2018, Ms Forbes spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast for Scotland a day after a Westminster debate on abortion, when she called on politicians to ""recognise that the way we treat the most vulnerable - whether the unborn or the terminally ill - is a measure of true progress"".

She was among the 15 SNP politicians who wrote an open letter to Ms Sturgeon the following year asking for a delay to gender recognition reforms that would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex.

The final vote on the proposals was held when Ms Forbes was on maternity leave, but when she launched her leadership campaign she made clear that she still had significant concerns about self-identification and would not have been able to vote for the legislation in its current form.

Several senior figures within the Scottish government reacted with fury to her comments, with Mr Swinney saying he profoundly disagreed with her views despite also having deep Christian faith.

Humza Yousaf warned that independence could only be won if the SNP sticks to ""progressive values"" and avoids a ""lurch to the right"".

The bubbling tensions boiled over in a televised STV debate, when Ms Forbes launched an attack on Mr Yousaf in which she slated his performance as a government minister.

Ms Forbes told Mr Yousaf: ""You were transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times.

""What makes you think you can do a better job as first minister?""

Ms Forbes presumably did little to endear herself to the SNP hierarchy watching at home - although Ms Sturgeon says she didn't tune in for the debate - when she declared that it was time for a new generation to lead the party and that ""more of the same is not a manifesto - it is an acceptance of mediocrity"".

The remark could be read as a dig at Mr Yousaf, who to some extent pitched himself as the ""continuity candidate"", and the record of Ms Sturgeon herself.

She later doubled down by saying she would potentially have space for Mr Yousaf in her cabinet if she won the contest - but not as health secretary.

Ms Forbes was born in Dingwall in the Highlands, but was partly raised in India as her parents travelled there twice as missionaries, the first time when she was four years old.

Her parents are reported to have been members of the more liberal Church of Scotland, with Ms Forbes claiming that she had chosen to join the Free Church after returning from India as it was ""just down the road"".

Ms Forbes (centre) had two spells in India during her childhood

She went to a Gaelic school while in Scotland and became a fluent speaker of the language as a child.

When she returned to India at the age of 10, she studied at Woodstock School - an international residential school in the foothills of the Himalayas.

She went on to complete degrees at Cambridge University and Edinburgh University and became a chartered accountant for Barclays in London.

She worked as an assistant to the SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, Dave Thompson, for two years before being selected to replace him when he stood down.

On the backbenches, the then 26-year-old campaigned to ban plastic straws and delivered a speech in the Holyrood chamber entirely in Gaelic.

In 2018 she entered government as public finance minister working alongside Derek Mackay, who she would go on to succeed as finance secretary when he was forced to stand down just hours before delivering his budget speech after it emerged he had sent inappropriate text messages to a 16-year-old schoolboy.

Ms Forbes became Scotland's first female finance secretary and was widely praised for delivering the budget speech with just a few hours' notice, having only received the call from Ms Sturgeon at 7am that morning.

She has said the SNP needs to win over No voters by using the Scottish Parliament's existing powers to show that"
17,"Scotland can flourish if it is to secure independence.

Ms Forbes had only a few hours to prepare for a budget speech after being appointed to the finance brief

Ms Forbes told the Guardian: ""We keep holding ourselves as hostages to fortune by setting a timetable rather than by focusing on what is really going to shift the dial.

""So day one, I would start the campaign for independence. But I would do that through gentle persuasion, making the economic case and earning people's trust back. The more successful and effective we are at that, the shorter the timetable becomes.""

She has said she would not raise income tax for higher earners and would instead focus on growing the economy and expanding the tax base by cutting red tape for businesses, improving transport infrastructure and having a ""cautious"" transition away from North Sea oil and gas.

Ms Forbes has also described the government's bottle return scheme as well-intentioned but ""badly executed"".

During a Channel 4 debate, presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy told Ms Forbes that her views on taxation and economic growth sounded ""a bit like Liz Truss"".

The three candidates were Ash Regan, Humza Yousaf and Kate Forbes

Little of this would be popular with the Scottish Greens, whose power-sharing deal with the SNP would have been very unlikely to survive under Ms Forbes - particularly because of her views on social issues.

The SNP's social justice secretary, Shona Robison, said she would have to think long and hard about whether she would serve in government under Ms Forbes, while the party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black, warned of a possible split if the finance secretary had won the leadership.

Several of her colleagues were said to have been furious over her attack on Mr Yousaf's record, which they believe will be quoted repeatedly by opposition parties as they seek to attack the SNP's record in government.

The Scottish Conservatives have already said they want to use Ms Forbes' remarks in their next party political broadcast.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards say seven officers have been killed in an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate building in Syria's capital, Damascus.

Brig-Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of the elite Quds Force, and Brig-Gen Mohammad Hadi Haji-Rahimi, his deputy, were named among the dead.

Iran and Syria's governments condemned the attack, which destroyed a building next door to the Iranian embassy.

The Israeli military said it did not comment on foreign media reports.

However, it has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran and allied armed groups which are armed, funded and trained by the Revolutionary Guards.

The Israeli strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria.

But Monday's attack will be seen as a serious escalation.

The Israelis appear to be testing the resolve of the Iranians and their allies and signalling that they are serious about increasing pressure on their enemies.

The Israelis are looking at the fact that both Iran and Hezbollah have not been pushing as hard as some might expect. Now they will see if Iran and Hezbollah are going to push back.

There will be a response, but it may not be the one people expect. Rather than missiles, it may be some sort of cyber-attack.

The Iranian embassy (left) does not appear to have been damaged in the strike on the next door consulate building

Syria's defence ministry said Israeli aircraft targeted the Iranian consulate building, which was on a highway in the western Mezzeh district of Damascus, from the direction of the occupied Golan Heights at about 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Monday.

Syrian air defences shot down some of the missiles they launched, but others made it through and ""destroyed the entire building, killing and injuring everyone inside"", the ministry added.

The ministry said work was under way to recover the bodies and rescue the wounded from beneath the rubble, without saying how many casualties there were or naming any of them.

Photos and videos from the scene showed smoke and dust rising from the remains of the collapsed multi-storey building. The Iranian embassy next door did not appear to have sustained any significant damage.

The Iranian ambassador, Hossein Akbari, said Israeli F-35 fighter jets ""brutally targeted my place of residence and the consular section of the embassy, along with Iran's military attaches"". He told Iranian state TV that between five and seven people were killed, including some diplomats.

Later, the Revolutionary Guards put out a statement saying that seven of its officers were killed, including Brig-Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Brig-Gen Mohammad Hadi Haji-Rahimi, whom it described as commanders and ""senior military advisers"".

Iranian media said Zahedi, 63, was a senior figure in the Quds Force - the Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations arm - and served as commander in Lebanon and Syria between 2008 and 2016. Haji-Rahimi was meanwhile identified as Zahedi's deputy.

Zahedi is one of the most high-profile Iranian figures believed to have been killed by Israel in the country's long campaign of targeted assassinations.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of sources on the ground in Syria, reported that eight people were killed - a high-ranking leader of the Quds Force, two Iranian advisers and five members of the Revolutionary Guards.

Syria's Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said he strongly condemned what he called ""this heinous terrorist attack"", adding that it had killed ""a number of innocent people"".

In a telephone conversation with Mr Mekdad, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian described the strike as ""a violation of all international obligations and conventions"" and ""blamed the consequences of this action on the Zionist regime"", the Iranian foreign ministry said.

He also ""stressed the need for a serious response by the international community"".

A White House spokeswoman said US President Joe Biden was aware of the reports.

In a briefing to journalists on Monday, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said an apparent drone attack on a naval base in the southern Israeli city of Eilat was ""a very serious incident"". The drone was ""made and directed by Iran"", he said.

This attack followed suspected Israeli strikes on Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo last Friday, which the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said killed 53 people, including 38 Syrian soldiers and seven members of the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.

In January, another strike in Mezzeh that was blamed on Israel killed five senior Revolutionary Guards and several Syrian security personnel.

Israel has previously acknowledged carrying out strikes in Syria to combat what it calls Iran's ""military entrenchment"", as well as shipments of Iranian weapons to allied groups which it proscribes as terrorist organisations.

Iran has said Revolutionary Guards have been sent to Syria to ""advise"" President Bashar al-Assad's forces in the country's civil war, but it has denied they have been involved in combat or established bases.

The Euclid telescope has successfully launched into space on a mission to understand some of the Universe's greatest mysteries.

The €1.4bn (£1.2bn) telescope was primed to go up on a Falcon-9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Saturday.

Euclid's goal is to make an immense 3D map of the cosmos in a bid to better understand so-called dark matter and dark energy.

Researchers know virtually nothing about these phenomena, which appear to control the structure and expansion of the cosmos.

Although primarily a European Space Agency project, the mission also has significant scientific and engineering inputs from the US space agency Nasa.

Euclid will carry out its work from an observing position"

Protester Matt Turnbull is one of the people arrested in the build up to the Coronation.

Dozens of people have been arrested during the King's Coronation, including the leader of a prominent anti-monarchy group.

London's Metropolitan Police said 52 arrests were made for a range of reasons, and all remain in custody.

Manchester City delivered a masterclass to overwhelm Premier League leaders Arsenal and strike a huge psychological blow in the title race at Etihad Stadium. The confrontation billed as a potential title-decider turned into an embarrassingly one-sided affair. Pep Guardiola's side, now two points behind Arsenal with two games in hand, were inspired by the devastating partnership of Erling Haaland and Kevin de Bruyne. Haaland sent De Bruyne away for a silky opener after seven minutes, and Arsenal then survived a constant bombardment of attacks before John Stones headed home from a free-kick in first-half stoppage time, the goal given by VAR after originally being ruled offside. City goal machine Haaland was outstanding throughout and again set up De Bruyne for the third in the 54th minute, the Belgian passing a classy finish between the legs of Gunners defender Rob Holding. Holding pulled one back for Arsenal late on before Haaland, denied four times by Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale earlier in the match, sealed a memorable night with his 49th City goal. City can go top with victory at Fulham on Sunday while Arsenal must somehow pull out of a slump that has seen them go four league games without a win at a crucial stage of the season.

Send us your views here City still have work to do to retain their title but, in the biggest game of the Premier League season, they delivered a brutal message. Guardiola was as fired up as his players in the early stages, raging in his technical area, even giving an animated lecture to goalkeeper Ederson after De Bruyne put them ahead. City were at their magnificent best as they tore holes in the Arsenal rearguard, the Gunners miraculously surviving all manner of close shaves after the opener before Stones' header gave them the cushion they deserved. Haaland had a rare night when his golden touch in front of goal deserted him until virtually the last kick of the game - although Ramsdale played his part in that - but the Norwegian demonstrated just how much his all-round game has improved under Guardiola by giving an exhibition in link-up play, twice assisting for De Bruyne and playing with an air of constant menace. And De Bruyne once more showed his enduring class with two precision finishes. The title is not run yet and no-one at City will be complacent, but this performance carried all the hallmarks of a side on a mission to keep their crown and who now have all the momentum with them. Another missed opportunity for the Gunners Manchester City 4-1 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta says team need to look in the mirror It was only a few short weeks ago that Arsenal's title challenge looked like it might well end with a first Premier League triumph since 2003-04. But that was before they carelessly threw away a two-goal lead at Liverpool, repeated the failing at West Ham and then faltered at home in a 3-3 draw with struggling Southampton. City presented the toughest of tests but also an opportunity to reassert themselves at the Premier League summit - but instead Mikel Arteta's team found themselves on the receiving end of a chastening beating. Arsenal looked nervous in the face of City's intensity and threat, the gap between the sides resembling a chasm right up to the final seconds when Haaland finally got on the scoresheet. The Gunners have desperately missed the authority of injured William Saliba in defence while they barely mounted an attack worthy of the name until it was too late. Arsenal have been outstanding this season and there will be no shame in coming up just short against this City team. If they do miss out - and remember, there is still hope - their recent dip in form will unquestionably leave them rueing a massive missed opportunity. If they are to somehow regroup from this mauling, they must do it quickly while also hoping City slip up somewhere along the line. On this evidence, however, that looks highly unlikely.

Nick Kyrgios has withdrawn from Wimbledon 2023 with a wrist injury.

The Australian, 28, lost to Novak Djokovic in last year's men's singles final and has only played one tournament this year because of a knee injury that required surgery.

Kyrgios announced on Sunday evening that he had torn a ligament in his wrist during his comeback.

""I'm really sad to say that I have to withdraw from Wimbledon this year,"" he posted on Instagram.

""I tried my hardest to be ready after my surgery and to be able to step on the Wimbledon courts again.

""During my comeback, I experienced some pain in my wrist during the week of Mallorca.

""As a precaution I had it scanned and it came back showing a torn ligament in my wrist.

""I tried everything to be able to play and I am disappointed to say that I just didn't have enough time to manage it before Wimbledon.""I'll be back and, as always, I appreciate the support from all my fans.""

Kyrgios was seeded 30th in SW19 and was set to face Belgian David Goffin in the opening round.

Wimbledon responded to Kyrgios' withdrawal by wishing him a ""swift recovery"" on social media.

""Sorry to hear your news Nick Kyrgios. Wishing you a swift recovery and hope to see you back on our courts next year,"" Wimbledon tweeted.

The start of an injury-hit season saw Kyrgios pull out of the Australian Open in January, a decision made on the eve of the tournament that left him ""devastated"".

Surgery on a cyst growing in his meniscus quickly followed and he was not able to return to competitive action until June.

Kyrgios suffered a first-round loss to China's Wu Yibing at the Stuttgart Open, struggling with his movement during a straight-set defeat, then pulled out of the Halle Open the following week.

He had been practising at the All England Club this week, saying his body felt ""OK"" after sets against fellow Australian Jordan Thompson and American Maxime Cressy.

Kyrgios, known for his fiery temperament as well as his exciting tennis, reached his"
19,"maiden major final at Wimbledon last year. He took the opening set before losing in four sets to Novak Djokovic.

Britain's Joe Salisbury and American Rajeev Ram, three-time major men's doubles champions, were due to face Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinaki in their opening doubles match.

The jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is facing a new trial on charges of extremism that could keep him in prison for decades.

Mr Navalny is already serving a nine-year sentence for parole violations, fraud and contempt of court.

He and his supporters insist his arrest and imprisonment in 2021 was politically motivated.

The latest trial will begin on Monday in the penal colony where he is being held, 250km (150 miles) east of Moscow.

Mr Navalny is facing multiple charges, including creating an extremist network and financing extremist activity.

He has said that could extend his prison term by up to 30 years.

The 47-year-old has long been the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin and has exposed corruption at the very heart of Russian power for more than a decade.

A charismatic campaigner, he seemed to be the only Russian opposition leader capable of mobilising people in large numbers across Russia to take part in anti-government protests.

He was arrested in 2021 upon returning from Germany, where he recovered from a poison attack the previous year that he blamed on the Kremlin. The Russian authorities denied any involvement.

In 2020, a report by the investigative outlet Bellingcat and Russian news site The Insider implicated several agents of Russia's internal security service, the FSB, in the attack.

He was initially jailed for two and a half years for breaking bail conditions while being treated in a German hospital, but was then given an extra nine years for fraud and contempt of court.

The latest case comes as the Kremlin intensifies its crackdown on opponents, more than a year after invading Ukraine, with most key opposition figures behind bars or in exile.

Mr Navalny said that prosecutors provided him with 3,828 pages outlining all the crimes he is alleged to have committed while behind bars.

""Although it is clear from the size of the tomes that I am a sophisticated and persistent criminal, it is impossible to find out what exactly I am accused of,"" Mr Navalny said.

He has been charged with financing extremist activity, publicly inciting extremist activities and ""rehabilitating the Nazi ideology"", among other crimes.

Rishi Sunak has reiterated that the UK ""discourages"" the use of cluster bombs after the US agreed to supply them to Ukraine.

The UK is one the countries to have banned the weapons, which have a record of killing civilians, under an existing convention.

The PM emphasised the government's continued support for Ukraine.

On Friday, US President Joe Biden said he had made a ""very difficult decision"" to supply them to Kyiv.

Spain and Canada, two of 123 nations to ban cluster bombs, have criticised the decision to send them, which has also been condemned by human rights groups.

Cluster munitions are a method of dispersing large numbers of tiny bomblets from a rocket, missile or artillery shell that scatters them in mid-flight over a wide area.

They are meant to detonate on impact, but a significant proportion of them fail to explode initially - often when they land on wet or soft ground. This means they can explode at a later date, killing or injuring people.

Neither the US, Ukraine or Russia are signatories of the international treaty - the Convention on Cluster Munitions - banning the use or stockpiling of them over the indiscriminate damage they can inflict on civilian populations.

Speaking to reporters in Selby, Yorkshire, on Saturday, Mr Sunak said the UK is ""signatory to a convention which prohibits the production or use of cluster munitions and discourages their use"".

""We will continue to do our part to support Ukraine against Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion, but we've done that by providing heavy battle tanks and most recently long-range weapons, and hopefully all countries can continue to support Ukraine,"" he added.

""Russia's act of barbarism is causing untold suffering to millions of people.""

Mr Sunak is due to meet with Mr Biden in London on Monday, ahead of a Nato summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Tuesday.

Rishi Sunak spoke carefully when asked for his response to the US now giving cluster munition to Ukraine.

He didn't criticise the US's decision but did point out that the Convention discourages use of the bombs.

The UK is the second largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine - only behind the US.

As the conflict in Ukraine evolves, so too are the responses of Kyiv's allies - on this issue the US and UK have gone in different directions.

Mr Biden justified supplying the weapons by saying the ""Ukrainians are running out of ammunition"".

Speaking to CNN in an interview due to air on Sunday, he said it had taken ""a while to be convinced"" to make the ""very difficult decision"" to send them.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the ""timely"" move to deliver the bombs.

Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said his troops would not use them in urban areas to avoid risking civilian lives, adding ""these are our people, they are Ukrainians we have a duty to protect"".

But Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles has said her government's position is that cluster bombs should not be used for the ""legitimate defence of Ukraine"".

Germany, which has also signed the convention, said it would not provide them to Ukraine but that it understands the American position.

In a statement, the Canadian government said it does not support the use of the weapons and emphasised its commitment to ""putting an end to the effects cluster munitions have on civilians - particularly children"".

Human Rights Watch said both sides had used the weapons in the war, causing ""numerous deaths and serious injuries to civilians"".

These comments were echoed by Amnesty International, who said cluster munitions pose ""a grave threat to civilian lives, even long after the conflict has ended"".

The UN human rights office has also been critical, calling for their use to ""stop immediately"".

Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the military alliance takes no position on cluster munitions.

Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the UK's defence select committee, urged the US to ""reconsider"" its decision - which he said was the ""wrong call and will alienate international goodwill"".

""Their use leaves deadly unexploded ordnance over the battlefield, killing and injuring civilians long after the war is over,"" the Conservative MP added.

Russia described the US decision as an ""act of desperation"" in the face of the ""failure of the much-touted Ukrainian counteroffensive"".

Rishi Sunak has refused to say whether Tory MPs accused of undermining the Commons Partygate inquiry into Boris Johnson should apologise.

The Privileges Committee said last week that the MPs, including Nadine Dorries and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, had tried to ""interfere"" with the probe.

Asked whether they should say sorry, the prime minister didn't say, adding he hadn't read the committee's report.

MPs will decide whether to approve the findings at a debate next Monday.

Last month, the Commons backed the committee's finding, in a separate report, that Mr Johnson misled Parliament over Covid rule-breaking in No 10.

Mr Sunak has never said whether he agrees"
20,"with the findings of that report - and missed last month's vote to approve it, blaming a diary clash.

The follow-up report by the Privileges Committee, published last week, said several allies of Mr Johnson had sought to ""influence the outcome"" of its original probe into the former prime minister.

It accused the seven MPs and three peers, all Conservatives, of mounting attacks on the committee designed to ""discredit"" its findings.

The report has led to a free speech row, with several of those named, including Ms Dorries and Sir Jacob, saying there is no reason they should not be able to criticise its conclusions.

At a scheduled appearance at the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Sunak did not respond to a question from Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant about whether the MPs named should apologise.

Instead, he said he had not read the report - which runs to a handful of pages - from ""cover to cover,"" although he was aware of its findings.

He confirmed he had asked Lord Zac Goldsmith, one of the Tory peers named in the report, to apologise - but said this was because of his then role as an environment minister.

Lord Goldsmith quit his government post last week, citing unhappiness with green policies. He has denied a claim from Mr Sunak that he had refused to apologise over being named in the report.

Sir Chris, who chairs the Privileges Committee but did not take part in its probe into Mr Johnson because he had criticised him before it began, also criticised Mr Sunak for missing the Commons vote on its findings.

The prime minister replied he couldn't attend because he was scheduled to speak at a charity event, but the Labour MP accused him of choosing ""not be in Parliament"".

""But yesterday, you opined on the rule of cricket. Take us through that,"" he added, in an apparent reference to Mr Sunak's criticism of the Australia team on Monday.

In a series of testy exchanges, he also took a swipe at Mr Sunak's attendance record in Parliament, noting that he is scheduled to miss the next two sessions of Prime Minister's Questions.

Mr Sunak replied he will miss this week's session because he is attending an event marking the 75th anniversary of the NHS, whilst next week he is at a summit of Nato leaders in Lithuania.

He denied that he had any control over the timing of the NHS event, telling Sir Chris ""I did not decide when that was.""

Violence has erupted across France since the killing of a 17-year-old during a traffic stop on Tuesday

A French policeman has been charged with homicide and is now in custody over the killing of a teenager during a traffic stop near Paris on Tuesday.

The 17-year-old, named as Nahel M, was shot at point-blank range as he drove off and crashed soon afterwards.

Anger at his killing has sparked violence across the country. A march led by the boy's mother was marred by clashes on Thursday afternoon.

In a third night of unrest, 667 people were arrested, French officials say.

In Paris, shops were ransacked and cars set on fire overnight despite a heavy police presence.

Across France, 40,000 police officers were deployed, with 249 of them injured in Wednesday night's clashes, according to the interior ministry.

Earlier, bus and tram services in Paris and the wider region stopped operating at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Thursday. Night-time curfews were in place in some suburbs.

In the town of Nanterre, where the teenager was killed, a huge fire engulfed the ground floor of a building where a bank is located.

Video and pictures on social media also appear to show piles of rubbish ablaze in several places.

Officers were injured on Thursday afternoon as well, during violence in Nanterre that followed a largely peaceful march calling for justice. It was attended by more than 6,000 people.

Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne said she understood the outpouring of emotion following the 17-year-old's death, but condemned the riots.

""Nothing justifies the violence that's occurred,"" she said.

The teenager's death has sparked a wider conversation about the power of the police and the relationship between the authorities and people from France's suburbs, who feel segregated from the country's prosperous city centres.

""We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,"" Nahel's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme.

But Nahel's mother said she did not blame the police in general, or the system, for the killing - just the officer who fired the lethal shot that killed her son.

The officer accused of killing him said he had fired because he felt his life was in danger. His lawyer told French radio station RTL that his client discharged his firearm ""in full compliance of the law"".

Speaking to the BBC on Friday morning, Thierry Clair, deputy secretary general of Unsad-Police trade union, said an investigation would ""determine whether this is a case of a legal or illegal use of a weapon"".

He said that by law, police officers may use their weapons in certain circumstances.

""The key thing is the principle of proportionality with the nature of the threat,"" Mr Clair said. ""For instance, one of the cases refers to stopping a vehicle whose occupants refuse to comply and present a risk for someone else if they attempt to escape.

""And the incident we're talking about - in which a weapon was used - might fall into that category.""

Comedy legend Peter Sellers played the title role - and two more - in Dr Strangelove

The family of director Stanley Kubrick have given their blessing for one of his classic films to be adapted for the stage for the first time.

His 1964 apocalyptic Cold War comedy Dr Strangelove will be staged by Armando Iannucci, who is known for TV political satires The Thick of It and Veep.

""As a story, weirdly it hasn't gone away,"" Iannucci told BBC News.

""It seems the right time to remind people of the mad logic behind these dangerous games that superpowers play.""

The show will be staged in London's West End next autumn, co-written and directed by double Olivier Award winner Sean Foley.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday Iannucci joked: ""In these sad times, what better way to cheer the nation up than a stage show about the end of the world.""

Director Stanley Kubrick (left) with Sellers in character as the US president

Kubrick's widow Christiane said: ""We have always been reluctant to let anyone adapt any of Stanley's work, and we never have. It was so important to him that it wasn't changed from how he finished it.

""But we could not resist authorising this project: the time is right; the people doing it are fantastic;"
21,"and Strangelove should be brought to a new and younger audience. I am sure Stanley would have approved it too.""

Daughter Katharina Kubrick added: ""The subject matter of this film is particularly relevant again in our prevailing political climate.

""People often laugh when they would rather cry, and this is exactly how the film, and now the play, handles the possibility of the ultimate destruction of life on Earth; certainly, an important topic amongst many, to concentrate the mind.""

The late director's family also granted access to Kubrick's archive, in which Iannucci said he had found papers relating to the film including ""some discarded scenes, first drafts [and] moments that they were going to shoot and then decided not to"".

He added: ""There are little shards of ideas there, and one or two of them have developed into full-scale new moments and new scenes in the final [play].""

Armando Iannucci is known for his TV and film work, but this is his first theatre project

Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb - to use its full title - was released two years after the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

Foley said it's not hard to see ""the relevance to the idea of a type of Cold War between the West and Russia"" today.

""That's sadly come very much back into our lives,"" he said. ""You don't have to look very far to understand a kind of relevance about the potential for nuclear conflict, given what's going on with the invasion of Ukraine and everything that Putin is saying.""

Iannucci added: ""Not just with the war in Ukraine, but also the whole apocalyptic sense of global warming and so on - it feels like a very relevant reassertion of the message that, this is the madness staring at us if we don't do anything about it.

""And currently, we aren't doing anything about it. So the outcome is not good.

""But if you can leave the theatre with that message and a smile, then all the better.""

The pair have decided to keep the story set in the 60s, and Iannucci said it would feel both ""retro"" in its setting, and up-to-date with some of his trademark dialogue.

""It's got one foot in the 60s and one foot in the present day,"" he said.

Foley added: ""There's something about how the men of that era behave in the film, and there was a specificity around the Cuban missile crisis and all of those things.

""And the look of it is great, so we quickly decided we're going to keep it in that period and let the obvious resonances just echo.""

The film famously starred Peter Sellers in three main roles - the titular German scientist, a British officer who discovers a US general has unilaterally ordered a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, and the American president who must attempt to avert all-out annihilation.

The stage version is now seeking a star to play multiple roles - albeit without the luxury of the time Sellers had to change costumes and make-up.

""They've got to be a great comic actor, of which we have very many,"" said Foley, who is artistic director of the Birmingham Rep. ""They've got to be of that shape-shifting kind of quality. They've got to want it.

""It's going to be a really tough gig. I'm sure some people, when we approach them, are going to go, 'No way, I'm not going to be compared with Peter Sellers in those roles.'

""But there will be someone who has the appetite and skill and talent and sees the opportunity to do it in their own way.""

In Dr Strangelove, many of those holding great power over millions of lives are depicted as often actually being inept, ridiculous, reckless or unhinged. That's a strand of political satire that Iannucci picked up in his work like The Thick of It, US version Veep, and 2017 black comedy The Death of Stalin.

""It's these individuals who are very human and very fallible, and yet on whose word and actions ride the fate of, in Stalin's case millions, and in Dr Strangelove's case humanity,"" he said.

The writer and director is now also working on another theatre project about Boris Johnson and his role in the pandemic and Partygate, although full details have not yet been announced.

""Rather than trying to do a TV exploration of what's happening now, doing something live on stage feels like just the right moment to do it,"" Iannucci said of that play.

""Also, in the last three years, we've been so enclosed in our homes because of the lockdown, and have got addicted to our screens, so actually going out and seeing something live and in the flesh is all the more exciting. That's what excites me about actually doing it as a live stage show.""

Carrick's sentencing hearing was told he had taken ""monstrous advantage of women"" between 2003 and 2020

More than 10 people have reported further offences by serial rapist and former police officer David Carrick since he was jailed, a force has said.

Carrick was sentenced to 36 life terms after admitting 49 charges, including 24 counts of rape, in February.

The 48-year-old committed most of his offences in Hertfordshire.

The county's police force said it was working with prosecutors and investigating the new reports, which included allegations of sexual assault.

Carrick's sentencing hearing was told he had taken ""monstrous advantage of women"" between 2003 and 2020, while serving as an officer with the Metropolitan Police.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The former police officer used his occupation to ""entice victims"", said Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb

Ordering him to serve to a minimum term of 32 years in jail, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said he had been ""bold and, at times, relentless, trusting that no victim would overcome her shame and fear to report you"".

She said ""for nearly two decades"", he had been ""proved right"", but a combination of the 12 women who reported him and the police colleagues who gave evidence against him had ""exposed you and brought you low"".

Following the hearing, Det Insp Iain Moor, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said officers had set up a special reporting portal for people to share information about Carrick.

""If anyone else thinks they have been a victim, we still want to hear from you and we will support you,"" he said.

In a statement, Hertfordshire Police said since February, ""more than 10 people have contacted their local forces or the investigation team directly, to either report further offences, including sexual assault, or to share information relating to him"".

""The team are now working with the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and investigating these new allegations,"" a representative said.

They added that they would not be releasing ""any further details relating to the new allegations"".

The DUP withdrew from the Stormont executive in February 2022

The DUP leader has said he is hopeful his party can get the progress it needs to go back into power sharing.

Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was speaking after a meeting with the head of the NI Civil Service, Jayne Brady.

He will continue to engage with the government and has made ""his summer available"" for further talks on the Windsor Framework, he said.

The party has insisted new legislation is needed before it will end its 18-month boycott of the executive.

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) walked out of Stormont's power-sharing executive in February 2022 in protest over a Brexit deal which introduced new checks and restrictions on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.

Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said new legislation may be required at Westminster and the government now has ""a lot more clarity"" about what the DUP is seeking.

Ms Brady's talks with the parties focused on how to run government in a future executive, in the context of a challenging budget position.

Speaking after"
22,"the meeting, Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill said this ""process has come to the end of the road"".

Ms O'Neill added she didn't share the secretary of state's ""overly optimistic assessment"" that a Stormont executive would return in the autumn.

Michelle O'Neill said the DUP needed to get over internal party wrangling and put people first

Last week Chris Heaton-Harris said he was ""hopeful"" about the return and believed a resolution was ""getting much closer"".

""I don't think there is any evidence to back that up,"" Ms O'Neill said.

""I hope that changes but I don't think anyone who was sitting in that meeting today is under any allusions that anything has changed in terms of the DUP's and the British government's game of chicken.""

Stephen Farry described Thursday's meeting with Ms Brady as a ""stock take exercise"", and said discussions had gone as far as they could.

The Alliance deputy leader said the current situation was ""stalemate"", with no progress over the past few weeks.

Mr Farry said he was deeply worried about the future of Northern Ireland and believed excuses were being made for parties to stay out of government.

The power-sharing government at Stormont collapsed in February 2022

Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said: ""I don't think it's about getting a bigger stick to beat the DUP with; I don't think that's going to work.""

He stressed that pressure was already on the DUP to return to the executive and he hoped Mr Heaton-Harris would assist in the restoration of Stormont.

Mr Beattie said he remained optimistic about a return of the executive by the autumn.

The SDLP was not at the talks as it has confirmed it will form the official opposition.

It feels like a process which has now passed its best before date.

It served a purpose in keeping the parties engaged with civil servants in the absence of Stormont.

It also allowed preparations to be put in place for the executive's return in the face of mounting budget pressures.

But with no hint of when or if Stormont might return, these talks have ""run out of steam"", to quote one party source.

With no best before date set for the talks between the DUP and the government, the political drift is likely to continue for some time.

Jayne Brady, who was appointed head of the NI Civil Service in June 2021, met political leaders on Thursday morning

Ms Brady has previously warned that even if ministers are to return to an executive this year, an overspend of this year's budget was ""now unavoidable"".

Ms Brady outlined her position in a letter to Mr Heaton-Harris earlier this month.

She said Stormont departments have ""reached the limit"" of what they can do to manage budget pressures this year and the remaining gap did not stem from an ""unwillingness"" to act, but from a legal position.

Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been evacuated unharmed from a public event after what appeared to be a smoke bomb was thrown at him.

A man was detained at the scene in Wakayama, where Mr Kishida had been due to give a speech, local media reported.

A witness said they saw a person throwing something, followed by smoke, while another said they heard a big bang. No injuries were reported.

Video showed officers piling on top of a person, believed to be a suspect.

He was arrested on suspicion of obstruction of business and later identified by the authorities as 24-year-old Ryuji Kimura. His motivation is still unclear.

Japan's public broadcaster, NHK, quoted Mr Kishida as saying there was a ""loud blast"" at the venue. ""Police are investigating details, but I'd like to apologise for worrying many people and causing them trouble.""

NHK broadcast footage in which crowds of people appear to be running away from the scene.

The footage also shows people swarm around one man, hold him down, and then carry him away.

A man believed to be a suspect in the smoke-bomb throwing was held by police officers

Mr Kishida had just started to deliver a speech after touring the fishing harbour in Wakayama for a campaign event when the object was thrown and he took cover.

After the incident, Mr Kishida addressed a crowd in another location and said the incident should not disrupt the electoral process.

A woman at the scene told NHK: ""I was stunned. My heart is still beating fast.""

A person who said they saw an object flying through the air said it gave them a ""bad feeling, so we ran away unbelievably fast"".

""Then we heard a really loud noise. It made my daughter cry,"" they added.

Another witness told NHK that the crowd began to disperse in panic before the blast was heard, as someone said an explosive had been thrown.

Hiroshi Moriyama, a member of Mr Kishida's Liberal Democratic Party, said: ""That something like this happened in the middle of an election campaign that constitutes the foundation of democracy is regrettable. It's an unforgivable atrocity.""

Violent attacks are extremely rare in Japan. But there is nervousness about security around politicians, after former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead while on the campaign trail last year.

Ukraine's top athletes have paid defiant tributes to a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW) shown apparently being killed by Russian troops in a video that has shocked the nation.

The unarmed prisoner is seen smoking in a trench. ""Glory to Ukraine!"" he says, before being shot.

Tennis star Elina Svitolina, Chelsea footballer Mykhailo Mudryk and others responded with ""Glory to the Heroes!"" in their video tribute.

It is a battle cry in Ukraine's army.

The saying became popular among ordinary Ukrainians after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014. It has seen a resurgence after Moscow's full-scale invasion launched last year.

In the tribute video posted online, Ukrainian athletes representing several sports appear one-by-one saying ""Glory to the Heroes!""

It comes after a passionate call by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: 'Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!'"" he said earlier this week.

Arsenal's Oleksandr Zinchenko and Taras Stepanenko, who plays for Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk feature in the video. Legendary former player and now coach Serhiy Rebrov is also shown.

Separately, Ukraine's boxing heavyweight world champion, Oleksandr Usyk, recorded a video of himself reciting a poem dedicated to the shot soldier, whose identity remains unclear.

""Glory to Ukraine! - for these words you got a bullet,"" he reads. ""You're no more - but memory is eternal of you, fighter"".

The graphic video first emerged on social media on Monday.

In the footage, one of the shooters - believed to be a Russian soldier - is heard saying ""die"" and using an expletive after the POW is shot dead with automatic weapons.

On Tuesday, Ukraine's military named the soldier as Tymofiy Shadura, citing preliminary information.

However, there is some doubt over his identity, with one well-known Ukrainian journalist naming him as somebody else.

The alleged killer or killers - who are not seen in the clip - have not been identified.

The BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made, or how the soldier was captured.

Ukraine's authorities have said the killing is ""another proof this war is genocidal"" and launched a criminal investigation, vowing to hunt down the perpetrators.

Russia has not publicly commented on the video.

Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russian troops of committing mass war crimes -"
23,"including torture, rape and murder - since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion. Russia denies the allegations.

Last July, a video emerged that showed another captured Ukrainian soldier being castrated in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

There have also been accusations against Ukrainian forces, with Moscow accusing soldiers of executing a group of Russian prisoners in November.

A Ukrainian official said the surrender was ""staged"" by Russian troops in an attempt to attack their captors.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been in the UK for talks with the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

The visit came ahead of a Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian forces, expected to begin in the coming weeks.

Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, the UK has been a major supplier of weapons and equipment to Kyiv, though on a much smaller scale than the US.

So what exactly is being sent, and how much of a difference is it making?

The UK confirmed that it had supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles earlier this month.

The Storm Shadow cruise missile has a range of over 250km (155 miles), according to the manufacturer.

By contrast, the US-supplied Himars missiles used by Ukraine only have a range of around 80 km (50 miles).

Currently, Storm Shadow has the longest range of any missile available to Ukraine, and can therefore strike targets previously believed to be safe by Russian forces.

Russia claims the system has already been used against its forces.

The UK is the first country to supply cruise missiles to Kyiv.

The UK also led the way in supplying Nato standard main battle tanks to Ukraine.

In January the UK announced that 14 Challenger 2 tanks would be sent, alongside around 30 AS90 self-propelled guns.

The Challenger 2 was built in the 1990s, but is significantly more advanced than Warsaw Pact standard tanks used by Ukraine.

Following the UK's announcement, several others committed to sending tanks to Ukraine, including Germany with its Leopard 2 model.

Many military analysts believe tanks, in co-ordination will other weapons systems, will be vital to any attempt by Ukraine to dislodge Russian forces from heavily fortified positions in the expected counter-offensive.

On Monday, Downing Street said that it would supply ""hundreds"" of attack drones and air defence missiles.

The statement did not reveal what kind of drones would be supplied, but it said they would have a range of over 124 miles (200km).

It is anticipated they may be used to hit logistics and control facilities deep behind Russian lines.

In 2022, the Ministry of Defence announced supplies of heavy lift drone systems to provide logistical support to isolated forces.

Analysts say that drones can be very effective in getting supplies over the ""last mile"" to front line troops, particularly under threat of Russian artillery fire and in situations where there is a risk of encirclement.

""It's the sheer quantity of stuff needed by troops,"" says Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). ""Every time you can use a drone instead of a soldier to get supplies forward is one less time someone is exposed to extreme danger.""

The donation of M270 multiple-launch rocket systems with M31A1 precision munitions to Ukraine was confirmed in 2022.

The UK's M270 system is similar to the American Himars launchers.

Jack Watling Rusi told the BBC: ""These systems are precisely what Ukraine needs. They allow the Ukrainians to out-range a lot of the Russian artillery systems and also to strike with precision.""

The UK has sent more than 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons, or Nlaw, to Ukraine.

Nlaws are designed to destroy tanks at short range with a single shot.

Crucially for Ukraine's armed forces who need weapons immediately, the missiles are easy to transport and simple to use. A soldier can be trained to use them in less than a day.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Many analysts believe they had a major impact on the course of the conflict in the days following Russia's invasion.

""Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,"" says Mr Bronk.

The weapons have been ""particularly effective"" when used in combination with artillery, he says.

Maritime Brimstone missiles were also sent to Ukraine in 2022.

Brimstones can be used against tanks, artillery and some smaller vessels such as landing craft, according to Capt Chris Carlson, formerly of the US Navy.

The missiles are normally fired from aircraft, but in Ukraine they are being modified to be fired from trucks.

Launching them from the ground reduces their effective range, says Capt Carlson.

When used as anti-ship missiles, Brimstones are far too small to sink larger vessels, but could cause substantial damage.

""It all depends where you hit,"" he says. ""If you went through an engine or near the water line, you could give an enemy some serious trouble.""

Britain has donated at least 120 armoured vehicles to Ukraine, including Mastiff patrol vehicles.

Mastiffs were very popular among British troops in Afghanistan as they provide a high level of protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices.

Analysts say that in an area which as been as heavily mined as the Donbas, Mastiffs are likely to be very useful.

It is understood that both sides in the conflict have used landmines extensively.

Britain says it has donated at least six air defence systems, including Starstreak missiles.

Starstreak is designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.

It ignores counter-measures such as flares and chaff deployed by many aircraft.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

""From a pilot's point of view, Starstreak is a very unpleasant thing,"" says Mr Bronk. ""There's very little you can do about it.""

He says Russian forces may deem some operations too risky if they are aware that a weapon as deadly as Starstreak is on the ground.

The UK has also supplied Stormer vehicles to act as a mobile platform for Starstreak missiles.

Other equipment supplied by the UK includes:

Andy Murray dazzled under the Wimbledon lights again as he led Greek fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in a Centre Court thriller stopped by a 23:00 BST curfew.

Britain's Murray is ranked 40th but showed his pedigree on the SW19 grass to lead 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-2) 6-4.

The second-round match was stopped at 22:39 because of the restrictions put in place by the local council.

Murray, who has regularly played late in recent years, and Tsitsipas will resume a captivating contest on Friday.

Moments after 36-year-old Murray had wrapped up the third set, tournament referee Gerry Armstrong walked on to the court and discussed stopping play for the night with each player.

Murray, who screamed out as he fell just before serving out for the lead, signalled to his team the match was being cut short, while 24-year-old Tsitsipas quickly packed his bags.

The pair will return to Centre Court after Spanish top seed Carlos Alcaraz plays France's Alexandre Muller in the first match, which starts at 13:30.
• None Djokovic set for 'duel of the veterans of the tour'

Eyes were instantly drawn to this potential blockbuster when the draw was made last Friday and, after both players negotiated their opening matches on different paths, it was billed as the box-office match of the tournament so far.

Further fuel was added by the memories from their feisty clash at the 2021 US Open, where Murray said he ""lost respect"" for Tsitsipas after a lengthy bathroom break before a final set which the Greek won.

This time, all the drama remained on the court.

Murray is a two-time champion at the All England Club and has"
24,"been talking bullishly about his chances of going deep in the draw this fortnight.

Despite missing out on a seeding, which left him vulnerable to a tough early test, the former world number one insisted he had the ability and nous to cause anyone problems.

For many people, Tsitsipas felt ripe to be on the end of an upset.

With grass not his favourite surface and a patchy record on the surface this year, there was an optimism among the home fans that Murray could earn his most notable Grand Slam win since having career-saving hip surgery in 2019.

After cruising past Ryan Peniston on Tuesday, the Scot also had the benefit of a day off, while Tsitsipas only came through a five-set duel with Dominic Thiem at almost 20:00 on Wednesday.

But the 2021 French Open runner-up and 2023 Australian Open finalist looked sharp - physically and mentally - as he showed glimpses of the form which has seen him long tipped to win one of the sport's four major titles.

There were tense moments in a tight first set where both players dominated on serve, Tsitsipas taking control of the tie-break to move ahead.

The second set followed a similar pattern.

Tsitsipas was edging the rallies as he continued to find range with his forehand, leaving Murray struggling to cope with his ferocious and consistent hitting from that side.

But, like he has done so often over the years, Murray continued to battle and managed to hold his service games with few issues as neither player conceded a break point.

That teed up another tie-break - and this time it was Murray who dominated it after finding his first serve when it mattered.

Murray playing under the floodlights on Centre Court always creates a special atmosphere and the player, by now demanding more noise from the almost-capacity crowd, thrived on the energy.

After not having a serious look at Tsitsipas's serve in the opening two sets, Murray broke to love right at the start of the third and maintained the momentum to move into the lead.

However, there was a serious scare when he fell on the baseline.

The sound of his scream, along with the knowledge of his injury history, left the whole of Centre Court anxious and there was relief when he clambered to his feet before serving out.

It had long felt the end of the third set was the natural point to suspend the match and once that was agreed, Murray walked off to a thunderous ovation.

Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg's show on GB News is one programme being investigated by Ofcom

The media expert who drew up the UK's broadcasting rules has urged the watchdog, Ofcom, to decide whether politicians should be allowed to present TV programmes on news channels.

Chris Banatvala said no-one foresaw the rise of politician presenters when the rules were being designed in the 2000s.

He said Ofcom should take ""a view about whether what is emerging is acceptable in terms of due impartiality"".

The regulator is reviewing its rules around politicians presenting TV shows.

Under Ofcom's rules, news must be presented with due impartiality, and politicians are not allowed to be newsreaders, interviewers or reporters ""unless, exceptionally, it is editorially justified"".

Ofcom says there are no rules against politicians hosting current affairs programmes, as long as they reflect a range of views.

But there's been a debate about how these rules apply to the growing number of programmes fronted by politicians on GB News and Talk TV, both relatively new channels.

Last month, Ofcom commissioned research into these programmes after receiving hundreds of complaints about politicians presenting shows.

Then this week, the regulator launched two investigations into potential rule breaches on two programmes, including the GB News show presented by the former cabinet minister, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg.

In the episode in question, Sir Jacob read out a breaking story about the jury verdict in a civil case involving the former US president, Donald Trump.

Writing in the Telegraph this week, Ofcom's chief executive, Melanie Dawes, said the regulator had a ""crucial role in preserving the integrity of broadcast news"" and a duty to ""ensure our rules remain effective"".

Mr Banatvala was Ofcom's director of standards when the regulator's rules around politicians presenting programmes were introduced in 2005.

He told the BBC that in a changing media landscape, we need ""a grown-up debate about whether and how we want to apply due impartiality to news"".

""It's evident now that news channels are blurring the boundaries between genuine news, current affairs and opinion,"" he said. ""That may be a good reason for Ofcom to look at these rules in the round.""

He added: ""We may need to look at whether these rules are fit for purpose, and whether we need to amend or adjust them.""

He said the tenor of programme on some channels in the UK ""is something that's come across the pond from America"".

It's long been common to see politicians hosting programmes that veer between partisan commentary and news coverage on channels such as Fox News in the US.

The UK's impartiality rules go back decades and were included in Ofcom's broadcasting code following its creation as the communications regulator in 2003.

If broadcasters are found to have breached the code, Ofcom has powers to impose fines and other sanctions.

When the impartiality rules were drafted, Mr Banatvala said, they were felt to"
25,"be ""ample and adequate to prevent any programme from using the same political party over and over again"".

""It wasn't ever envisaged that a news channel would use politicians from the same political party to present programmes, day in, day out,"" he said.

Grilling two Ofcom directors at a meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in Parliament on Tuesday, SNP MP John Nicolson asked why the regulator was not taking more action over programmes fronted by sitting politicians.

John Nicolson suggested Jacob Rees-Mogg's show had ""the grammar of a news programme""

Singling out Mr Rees-Mogg's programme on GB News, Mr Nicolson said ""every day, he churns out the same pro-Brexit, right-wing stuff"", arguing ""what he's doing is blurring news presenting and commentary"".

He asked: ""Why don't you act to stop this?""

Kate Davies, Ofcom's public policy director, said the watchdog looks at current affairs programmes ""differently"" to those focused solely on news.

Following further frank exchanges, Mr Nicolson said ""we've lost all sight of objective journalism"" and suggested ""we're going to proceed down a route where we end up with awful, American-style ranting at the camera, we're already seeing it, masquerading as news"".

Kate Biggs, Ofcom's content policy director, said the media watchdog takes its responsibility on impartiality and accuracy rules ""very seriously"".

She said the regulator's investigations into programmes ""do set a precedent for other editors"".

TalkTV said it ""will engage with the Ofcom process and looks forward to defending its output.""

GB News has also been contacted for comment.

Tewkesbury Academy was locked down following the attack on Monday morning but reopened on Tuesday

A teenage boy has been charged after a teacher was stabbed in a corridor at a school.

The 15-year-old was charged with attempted wounding with intent and possession of bladed article following the attack at Tewkesbury Academy.

Maths teacher Jamie Sansom was wounded just after 09:00 BST on Monday.

The boy, who cannot be named due to his age, remains in police custody and will appear at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

He was arrested in Stoke Orchard, some three miles (4.8km) from the school, about two hours after the stabbing.

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Sansom, who has taught at Tewkesbury Academy since 2017, said he had not been breaking up a fight between students when he was wounded.

He said he was ""recovering well"" from his injuries and hoped to be back in the classroom before the summer break if doctors gave him the ""all-clear"".

Police said he suffered a single stab wound and was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and was discharged later the same day.

Jamie Sansom said he had received more than 100 messages of support, which he described as ""a big boost""

The academy was locked down and two neighbouring schools were also asked to shut their doors as a precaution following the incident, Gloucestershire Police said on Monday.

It added there would be a police presence at the school over the coming days to provide reassurance to pupils.

Nominations for those seeking to stand in May's local government elections have closed.

The poll on 18 May was pushed back by two weeks due to the coronation of King Charles III on 6 May.

It will be the first electoral test for Northern Ireland's political parties since last May's assembly elections.

There are 462 seats that will be contested in all of Northern Ireland's 11 councils.

Those seeking to be candidates in the election had to have their documentation submitted before the deadline.

The DUP won the most council seats in 2019 elections at 122 seats with Sinn Féin not far behind on 105.

However, they were overtaken by Sinn Féin in last year's assembly election.

Since then, there has been stalemate at Stormont with the DUP's boycott of the executive and assembly in protest at the post-Brexit trading arrangements.

Northern Ireland councils are funded via rates, government grants and fees charged for local services.

They look after a range of services, including waste collection and disposal, local planning, street cleaning, sport and leisure services, and parks and open spaces.

The elections use the single transferable vote (STV) system, the same as is used for elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly.

For more information on what's at stake, read BBC News NI's local election guide.

Temperatures in southern Europe are expected to peak on Tuesday, as a days-long heatwave continues.

Firefighters have been battling wildfires in countries across the region, including in Spain, Greece, and Switzerland.

Biden spoke of threats to democracy during speech

On the motorcade route outside Ulster University earlier, a lone Trump flag waved to greet the US president. A familiar sight in America - but an unexpected one for this president who so proudly touts his Irish-American ties to this place. Another protester nearby held a sign that read ""Fake Catholic. Fake president."" Between folksy anecdotes designed for laugh lines about what Northern Ireland and the Republic mean to him, President Biden's remarks didn't focus solely on the international politics of this visit. “Those of you who have been to America know there is a large population that is invested in what happens here,” Biden said during his speech at Ulster University. ""Supporting the people of Northern Ireland, protecting the peace, preserving the Belfast Good Friday Agreement is a priority for Democrats and Republicans alike in the United States, and that is unusual today because we have been very divided in our parties.” The president's oft-repeated ode to the importance of democracy here, in America, and around the world was not missing from his brief remarks. And his reference to the threats that American democracy faced during the 6 January riots at the US Capitol two years ago won’t have fallen on deaf ears for a city whose residents were once no stranger to persistent conflict and violence.

Band member Ian 'H' Watkins told Chippenham Pride he did not want to perform in Dubai because of the human rights issues there

Steps turned down a show in Dubai over a contract clause which stated they were not allowed to mention sexuality, band member Ian 'H' Watkins has said.

He told Chippenham Pride in Wiltshire he was at a point in his life where morals were more important than a ""pot of gold gig"".

Watkins said nobody had known Steps were offered the show in the Middle East but he said it was ""important"" to raise the issue.

In an interview with Bobbi Pickard, chief executive of Trans in the city, on Saturday, Watkins said he was ""emotional"" that he had not spoken up sooner and wished he had had ""the guts"" to do so.

""This week we were offered a gig, a show, and it was in a country where there's lots of oppression, where the LGBTQ+ community is treated so horrendously,"" he said.

""And in the contract it said 'no mention of sexuality' and that really jarred with me.

""I'm at a point in my life now where my morals and what I strive for is more important that that pot of gold gig was in Dubai,"" he said.

The popstar organised the first-ever Pride for his hometown of Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan

Mr Watkins said he gave his reasons for not wanting to perform.

""It's because of all the horrendous human rights issues that are happening there,"" he said.

Dubai is one of the United Arab Emirates, which has strict laws against homosexuality.

Nearby Qatar, which hosted the 2022 World Cup, has similar rules.

It was criticised for its attitude to LGBT people, its human rights record and its treatment of migrant workers.

""Respecting and backing H's position has shown fabulous allyship,"" Ms Pick"
26,"ard said.

""They [Steps] have a strong Pride community following, and this reinforces their support and love for their fans.""

She added she would like to see other artists follow in Steps' example and think twice about performing in places where people in their fan base face imprisonment or the death penalty.

Ian ""H"" Watkins publicly came out in 2007, a decade after Steps launched

Mr Watkins said he had told the band they were welcome to perform without him, but the band decided to follow his decision.

He said regardless of one's gender, sexuality, or colour, people should be able to live their best life, and be their authentic selves.

""It felt like a little win.

""If everybody did that, all of those ripples will make huge waves, and we will have a much more inclusive and beautiful place to live.""

Water cremation is set to be made available for the first time in the UK.

The process, known as resomation, uses a mix of potassium hydroxide and water to break down human remains in what is billed as a more sustainable option.

It takes four hours - the bones remain, and are powdered then returned to loved ones in a similar way to ashes, in an urn.

Resomation is used in Canada, South Africa and many US states.

It will be the first alternative way to dispose of a body in the UK since the introduction of the Cremation Act in 1902 - and Co-op Funeralcare will be the first to offer it, starting later this year.

The British company Resomation, which supplies the equipment, claims the process produces a third less greenhouse gas than cremation and uses a seventh of the energy.

According to the founder of the company, Sandy Sullivan, the liquid used in resomation is ""safely returned to the water cycle free from any traces of DNA"".

Anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu chose the process for his funeral arrangements in South Africa - he died in late 2021.

Gill Stewart, managing director of Co-op Funeralcare, said that ""land for burials is running out"", and that resomation could help the industry ""improve its carbon reduction targets and meet the capacity challenges of a growing population"".

The funeral provider anticipates that the cost of resomation will be similar to that of a traditional cremation.

Initially, resomation will only be offered in certain locations - which are yet to be announced - with the intention of expanding it across the UK, the funeral chain said.

The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann will not face German charges for alleged rape and sexual abuse in a separate case.

Last year, a court in the city of Braunschweig charged Christian Brueckner with five sexual offences.

But it now says it does not have jurisdiction because Brueckner last lived in a different part of Germany.

Brueckner has never been charged over Madeleine's disappearance and has denied any involvement.

In October 2022, evidence for additional allegations emerged during the McCann investigation.

Braunschweig's chief prosecutor charged Brueckner with five offences alleged to have been carried out between 2000 and 2017 in Portugal, including the rape and the sexual abuse of two children.

The five charges in full:

Although the court in Braunschweig has dropped the case, it is understood Brueckner could still be charged with the same offences in a different court in Germany.

Originally the case was taken up in Braunschweig because that was the region where he was last officially registered.

But in reality, before moving to Portugal, he had been living in a caravan in the state of Saxony Anhalt.

It is expected that prosecutors in other parts of Germany will now decide whether to pursue the charges and stake a claim to jurisdiction.

Three-year-old Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was on holiday with her family at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz, in Portugal's Algarve when she disappeared on 3 May 2007. Her whereabouts remain unknown.

Brueckner has never been charged over her disappearance.

The convicted sex offender is currently serving a seven-year sentence for rape which he committed in 2005 in Portugal.

A mum who lost her youngest son in a caravan fire has said she has been given months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Erin Harvey lost a son as a baby after he was born prematurely before Zac was killed three years ago - and now the 30-year-old has a rare form of cancer.

Erin has written birthday and wedding cards for her two surviving sons, one of whom was seriously hurt in the fire.

""They've already lost brothers and now they'll lose their mum,"" she said.

""Just knowing that I'm not going to be there to watch them grow up, that's the hardest thing about this whole situation.""

Erin is focusing on making her remaining time fun for sons Alex, 13, and eight-year-old Harley - and plans to marry partner Dan before she dies.

""We want to have a nice big celebration with all our family and friends,"" said Erin, who is from Ceredigion in mid Wales.

""We want to go to Legoland for Harley. We've got a camper van so, in between chemotherapy, we'll take any chance we get to go away and make memories.

""And we hope to have one last big, happy Christmas with all of the family around.

Zac (left) died, aged three, in a caravan fire three years ago while his brother Harley, who was then four, survived

""My main focus now is making the most of the time we have. I'm just not thinking about all the things that I'm going to miss and all of the things that we won't get to do.""

Erin, who has been documenting her cancer journey on TikTok, had been trying for a baby with fiancé Dan, who she was due to marry - but they are hoping to bring the wedding forward to this year.

Erin, fiancé Dan and Harley are trying to go away in their camper van as much as they can

""I've been trying to distract myself by doing positive things so I'm making the boys' scrapbooks and have bought birthday cards all the way up to their 21st birthdays,"" said Erin.

""I've also done cards for their weddings and when they pass their driving tests.

""I'm just focusing on the now and making this next few months as normal for the kids as we possibly can. I have to be strong for them, I don't want them seeing me being upset all of the time.""

Erin's second son Tyler, who had health complications after being born prematurely, died in December 2012 when he was just a few months old after suffering a cardiac arrest.

Erin says the hardest thing she is dealing with is the knowing her two sons will grow up without their mum

Erin's fourth and youngest son Zac died, aged three, during a sleepover with his dad Shaun after suffering smoke inhalation in a caravan fire in January 2020 that was probably caused by an electric fan heater.

Zac's elder brother Harley suffered lifechanging injuries in the blaze after being airlifted to Bristol in a critical condition. He was treated in hospital for six weeks and was not expected to survive but has now recovered.

Now Erin, a support worker for adults with disabilities who lives in Pontrhydfendigaid in Ceredigion, has been diagnosed with stage four Ampullary cancer, a rare form of the disease related to the digestive system.

Erin had surgery to remove the tumour but the cancer has spread and now friends have started an online fundraiser to help the family ""make magical memories"".

""It's terminal and I have been given months rather years to live,"" said Erin.

Erin Harvey has documented being diagnosed with cancer on social media

""I don't think anyone thinks they'd have that conversation with their kids about this situation, especially not at 30 years old and when they're"

""It's a bit scary isn't it after only two weeks to see those results.""

Aimee, 24, has spent two weeks on an ultra-processed diet as part of a test carried out by scientists from King's College London for BBC Panorama.

Her identical twin, Nancy, was also on a diet containing exactly the same amount of calories, nutrients, fat, sugar and fibre - but she was consuming raw or low-processed foods.

Aimee gained nearly a kilo in weight - Nancy lost weight. Aimee's blood sugar levels also worsened and her blood fat levels - lipids - went up.

This was a short-term study on just one set of twins, but the results highlight growing fears among some scientists about the possible impact of so-called ultra-processed foods on our health, which BBC Panorama has been investigating.

Prof Tim Spector, is a professor of epidemiology at King's College London, who studies trends in disease and oversaw the test.

He told BBC Panorama: ""In the last decade, the evidence has been slowly growing that ultra-processed food is harmful for us in ways we hadn't thought.

""We're talking about a whole variety of cancers, heart disease, strokes, dementia.""

The term ultra-processed foods - or UPF - was only coined 15 years ago but it makes up about half the things we now eat in the UK.

From sliced brown bread to ready meals and ice cream, it is a group of foods made with varying - but often substantial - levels of industrial processing. Ingredients used, such as preservatives, artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers, do not typically feature in home cooking.

""Ultra-processed foods are among the most profitable foods companies can make,"" says Prof Marion Nestle, a food politics expert and professor of nutrition at New York University.

Some academics think the link is not coincidental.

Ultra-processed convenience foods contain chemicals that UK regulators say are safe, but Panorama investigates emerging scientific evidence of a link between some of these chemicals and cancer, diabetes and strokes.

In January, one of the most comprehensive studies on ultra-processed food - by Imperial College's School of Public Health - was published in The Lancet medical journal.

The study of 200,000 UK adults found that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods may be linked to an increased risk of developing cancer overall, and specifically ovarian and brain cancers.

And, as of last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now cautioning against the long-term use of artificial sweeteners - citing potential health risks.

It follows dozens of studies linking increasing consumption of UPF to increased risk of developing serious illnesses.

But proving that specific ingredients cause human harm can be challenging - there are a range of other factors in our lifestyles that can cause these diseases. For example: lack of exercise, smoking or sugary diets.

The first investigations into mortality and consumption of ultra-processed food started in France at the University Sorbonne Paris Nord, as part of the ongoing study into the eating habits of 174,000 people.

""We have 24-hour dietary records during which they tell us all the foods, the beverages and so on, that they are eating,"" explains Dr Mathilde Touvier who heads up the study.

The ongoing research has already published results showing UPF may drive an increased burden of cancer.

Nancy (l) and Aimee (r) took part in the two-week long test

More recently, they have been looking into the impact of one specific ingredient - emulsifiers - which act as a glue in ultra-processed foods to hold everything together.

Emulsifiers are the Holy Grail for the food industry - they improve the appearance and texture of food, and help to extend the shelf life far beyond that of less-processed food.

They're everywhere, in mayonnaise, chocolate, peanut butter, meat products. If you eat, you're likely to be consuming emulsifiers as part of your diet.

BBC's Panorama was given exclusive access to Dr Touvier's early results.

They are yet to be peer reviewed - a crucial verification step for scientific studies - but she said they are still concerning.

""We observed significant associations between emulsifier intake and increased risk of cancer overall - and breast cancer notably - but also with cardiovascular diseases,"" she says.

This means that a pattern has been observed between consuming ultra-processed food and disease risk, but further research is needed.

Despite the growing body of evidence, the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) - which regulates the food industry in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - has yet to issue any regulation restricting emulsifiers.

When Panorama asked the FSA about the growing body of evidence that these additives could cause harm it said: ""We have not been presented with any evidence - by this programme or otherwise - of any specific emulsifiers which are believed to pose a risk to health.""

But the FSA said it planned to hold a public consultation.

Could the food industry itself be playing a role in pushing back on regulation?

The BBC Panorama team spent the past eight months investigating.

""Food companies are not public health agencies... their job is to sell products,"" food politics expert Prof Nestle told the BBC.

She said the food industry has been known to fund research, sponsor experts and disparage existing studies to prevent regulation.

The International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) is a body that receives funding from some of the world's largest food companies.

It says its mission is to ""provide science that improves human health"" - but it has previously published studies globally undermining regulation and public guidance on healthy diets. In 2012, the European Food Safety Agency was so worried about potential conflicts of interest, it insisted anyone associated with ILSI either had to resign from the institute or leave the agency.

Prof Alan Boobis, emeritus professor at Imperial College London, is an unpaid director of ILSI Europe and a former vice president of its board of directors. But he also heads up a group of UK scientists, known as the Committee on Toxicity which provides advice on the risk of chemicals in food to the FSA.

More than half the members of the committee have recent links to the food or chemicals industries. And over the past 10 years, the committee hasn't supported a single restriction on the use of any chemical additive in our food.

Prof Boobis told Panorama his advice wasn't slanted to favour industry, and he had always been ""totally committed to conducting and identifying the very best scientific research... whoever is funding it.""

The Food Standards Agency said it had a ""clear code of conduct… for declarations of interest"" and that it had ""no evidence"" bias has affected its decisions.

ILSI said: ""[We] operate within a framework of the highest principles of scientific integrity.""

One of the most controversial additives in UPF is the sweetener aspartame.

Two-hundred times sweeter than sugar, it has been heralded as a great low-calorie alternative - turning once unhealthy sugary drinks, ice cream and m"
28,"ousses into products marketed as ""healthy"".

There have been questions about its potential harm over the past two decades.

Then, last month, the World Health Organization said, although the evidence is not conclusive, it was concerned that long-term use of sweeteners like aspartame may increase the risk of ""type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and mortality"".

Aspartame is sometimes used to sweeten ice cream

In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) decided - after looking at all the available evidence - that aspartame was safe. The UK's Food Standards Agency accepted this position.

The Committee on Toxicity looked at a study into aspartame in 2013 and concluded that the results ""did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public"".

Six years later, Prof Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, decided to review the same evidence considered by EFSA - to see who had funded the different studies.

He discovered that 90% of the studies defending the sweetener were funded by large chemical corporations that manufacture and sell aspartame.

And that all the studies suggesting that aspartame may cause harm were funded by non-commercial, independent sources.

A spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation, a membership body for manufacturers, told the BBC that companies took ""the health of consumers, and safety of the food they produce, seriously - and adhere to the strict regulations"".

A spokesperson for the International Sweeteners Association said: ""Low/no calorie sweeteners are safe to use, are amongst the most thoroughly researched ingredients in the world and have been approved by all major food safety bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.""

The FSA says it will look into WHO's ongoing assessment of aspartame. And the government says it is aware of the growing concerns around UPF and has ordered a review into the evidence on ultra-processed foods.

For Dads By Dads runs a 10-week programme to educate new and expectant dads

A dad who suffered a breakdown after witnessing the traumatic birth of his son says the impact a new baby can have on fathers is often overlooked.

Mark Williams, 48, said both the birth and supporting his wife through postnatal depression had a ""massive impact"" on his mental health.

""The first time I had a panic attack was in the labour ward thinking my wife and baby were going to die,"" he said.

Mark, from Bridgend, said he suffered in silence with depression for years.

Mark was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and later ADHD after the birth of his son

Then in 2004 when his wife went into labour he witnessed her in prolonged pain and had to stand by helpless when she was rushed to theatre.

When their baby was still small his wife was diagnosed with post-natal depression.

""Obviously I witnessed my wife go through those things as well,"" he said.

""I was really unwell, I was drinking, avoiding situations.""

He began looking for support but struggled, and found a lack of conversation around new dads and mental health.

He was eventually diagnosed with anxiety and depression and later Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

He said therapy, medication and learning coping skills through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy all played a part in improving his mental health.

Today he is an advocate for fathers' mental health and wants to see more support for new and expectant dads.

""If dad is suffering with mental health or confidence, whatever that looks like, that can have an impact on the relationship and obviously on the child as well,"" he said.

""So it's really important that all parents should have our support.""

Mark has been supporting the For Dads By Dads group in Torfaen, educating new and expecting men on the challenges of the early years of fatherhood.

The group was set up by another dad, Jacob Guy, who said: ""There were times where I did feel a little bit isolated and needed more information to be the best dad that I could be.

Jacob Guy found a lack of support for new dads when he became a father so set up a group

When Jacob, 41, from Chepstow, Monmouthshire, became a dad he felt that he did not have a network of people who were going through the same thing and would understand how he was feeling.

He looked around for dad groups but was unable to find the support he was looking for.

In 2022 he decided to set up a 10-week programme aimed to give dads a safe space and to educate new and expectant dads by running workshops covering a wide range of subjects.

For Dads, By Dads aims to build confidence in new fathers

The group gives opportunities to fathers to share experiences, build a network of support and tackle the challenges that come with fatherhood.

And that support is vital: According to the British Journal of Midwifery, one in 10 fathers are affected by post-natal depression, which is about the same rate as mothers.

Up to 38% of new dads are worried about their mental health and want more support, according social enterprise DadPad, which was developed with the NHS and real-life dads.

The Welsh government said it was investing in the development of perinatal mental health teams and networks.

""We remain committed to improving perinatal mental health services and will consider what further action can be taken,"" it said.

Jacob said he had seen the positive impact being around other dads had had on new fathers.

""It's built their confidence to know we're not going to get it right all the time,"" he said.

""If we make mistakes, we dust ourselves down and we start again.""

A five-month-old baby has been taken to hospital after a dog attack, police have said.

Emergency services were called to Penyrheol, Caerphilly county, on Saturday morning, Gwent Police said.

The baby was taken to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. The child's injuries are unknown but are not believed to be life-threatening.

Caerphilly MP Wayne David said he was shocked by the incident, after two recent fatal dog attacks in the area.

All three incidents have happened within a half mile (about 0.8 km) radius of each other.

The Welsh Ambulance Service confirmed it was called to a dog attack at 09:00 BST.

Caerphilly councillor, Greg Ead, said witnesses heard screams coming from the property at the time of the attack.

Local groups met on Thursday to discuss how to stop the rising numbers of attacks, with campaigners saying more needs to be done.

Police say they will be making further inquiries and will remain at the scene as the investigation continues

Gwent Police said officers seized the dog and confirmed no other animals were involved.

""We were called to an address in Penyrheol, Caerphilly at around 9.10am on Saturday 29 April, following reports of a dog attack,"" said the force.

""A five-month-old baby has been taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

""The dog was seized by officers. No other animals were involved in the attack.""

Chief Insp Laura Bartley said officers would be making further inquiries and would ""remain at the scene as the investigation progresses"".

""It is possible that you may see ongoing police activity in Caerphilly as part of this work, but please do not be alarmed.

""If you have concerns or information then please do stop and talk with us.""

Penyrheol councillor, Greg Ead, said his son was staying at his girlfriend's home on the same street where they heard and shouts and screams.

Mr Ead called the attack ""traumatic"" for everyone on the road.

""I think another death would be absolutely devastating for this community,"" he said.

The incident comes after"
29,"two fatal dog attacks in the area. The latest is understood to have happened at Y Cilgant in Penyrheol.

A previous dog attack in Penyrheol saw Jack Lis, 10, killed by an XL Bully dog back in 2021

Jack Lis, 10, from Caerphilly, died after being mauled by an American or XL Bully dog - a legal breed - in November 2021.

And Shirley Patrick, 83, died in hospital after suffering a ""violent and unnatural"" death after being attacked by a dog in Caerphilly in December.

Jack's mum Emma Whitfield has been campaigning for changes in the law about breeding and selling dogs since his death.

""At the moment anyone can buy and sell a dog with no knowledge of where the dog has come from or who it is going to,"" she told BBC Wales on Sunday.

Ms Whitfield said she wanted to see more emphasis placed on breeding and selling dogs.

""With owners, I think people need to start realising that they have responsibilities.

""This problem is not going away.""

In February, Welsh Labour MS Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh government had updated its animal welfare licensing regulations and closed ""loopholes relating to pet sales"".

She told the Senedd: ""We need to make sure the public are making informed decisions when they buy a pet, but there is absolutely more we can do.

""I've asked officials to actually start to look at dog licensing again.""

Details of the dog's breed involved in Saturday's attack has not yet been released by police.

Caerphilly MP Wayne David added: ""There have been a number of incidents around Penyrheol.

""It shows there needs to be recognition that all dogs are potentially dangerous, particularly ones with a strong physique.

""Dogs like this need to be handled with great care and caution. They need to be trained properly.

""It's about responsible dog ownership. Children should not be able to go near them.

""The more general issue is all sorts of cross breeds being breed for the wrong reason with many not appropriate to be pets. They are bred to be violent.

""Not sure that's the case here.

""The aim is to have a different kind of approach to the issue of dogs.

""We must make sure that all owners are aware of what they are taking on when they are small puppies to make sure that people recognise that keeping a dog like this is a big undertaking.""

Mr David said it was too difficult to ban certain breeds because of crossbreeding.

""So many of these breeds are now cross breeds, it's not that easy, you would have a list of thousands of breeds.

""What is happening is that the regulations are being broken, the wrong kinds of dogs are being bred.""

Researchers in Cambridge are developing gene-edited potatoes that don't bruise in order to reduce food waste

Gene-edited food can now be developed commercially in England following a change in the law.

Supporters of the technology say it will speed up the development of hardier crops that will be needed because of climate change.

Critics say that the change could bring ''disaster'' to our food production and the environment.

Gene editing involves making precise changes to an organism's DNA to enhance certain characteristics.

The new law also opens the door to the development of gene-edited farm animals, but a further vote by MPs will be required before it is allowed, again only in England.

The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments have not permitted the commercial use of gene editing.

Scientists say that gene editing can help to produce new climate-change resistant crops quickly

Gene editing in England had been covered under the same tight regulation that has restricted the commercial development of GM crops under EU law. Brexit has enabled the Westminster government to relax the rules for the newer technology.

The chief scientific advisor for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Prof Gideon Henderson, says that the new rules will lead to better food production and bring jobs and investment to England.

""What's changed is that we can now use precision breeding technology developed in the lab and take it into the fields so that we can grow better crops and bring them to market more readily so that we can use the technology to enhance agricultural outcomes and food production in the UK and globally,"" he said.

The Precision Breeding Act allows only genetic changes that could also have been produced naturally or through traditional crossbreeding programmes already in use today. GM can involve the introduction of genes from other species and will not be permitted.

Gene editing enables researchers to make precise genetic changes to a plant's DNA, for example adding a gene to boost its growth or reduce dependence on fertiliser. The same change could be produced by crossbreeding different varieties, but it would take much longer.

The new law allows for the use of gene editing and other methods that may arise in the future, provided the end result is a crop that is no different to a variety that could have been naturally produced.

Gene-edited tomatoes rich in a chemical with calming effects are on sale in Japan

Critics of genetically altered food, such as Pat Thomas of Beyond GM, are concerned that gene-edited crops will not have to go through the extensive testing required of GM foods in the EU, which may result in the introduction of toxins and allergens into the food chain.

""The entire process of this bill has been of the government consulting scientists with vested interests, usually in the biotech industry, who are reassuring the government that this change in the law will have no consequences,"" she said.

""History has shown that when you remove regulatory control, particularly for food and the environment, there is looming disaster on the horizon.''

Defra's response is that the Food Standards Agency, the FSA will only authorise products for sale if they are judged to present no risk to health.

There is also concern that labelling of gene-edited food is not a requirement and it is unclear how GE food from England will be prevented from entering other parts of the UK, where it is still banned.

A US firm is gene editing blackberries that don't have seeds

A Welsh Government spokesperson said that this would create ""unavoidable consequences for Wales"".

""Gene-edited plants, animals and products from England will be marketable here without the authorisations our law requires,"" they said.

""This undermines the devolution settlement. The UK Government chose not to engage with us, despite our efforts, whilst developing the bill and this means the effects of it have not been properly considered.""

The Scottish government has a long-standing opposition to GM and wishes to stay in step with the EU, though its stance is opposed by NFU Scotland who says it puts Scottish farmers at a competitive disadvantage.

The Northern Ireland government has to follow the protocol negotiated with the EU which requires that it remains in step with rules regarding the definition of GM crops in Europe, which also cover gene-edited crops.

There is however enthusiasm for the use of gene editing among some plant breeders in England.

The National Institute of Agricultural Botany, just outside Cambridge, has been breeding new varieties of crops for UK farmers for more than a hundred years.

They crossbreed different varieties to produce new ones that grow better and are more resistant to diseases. It can take ten to fifteen years of development. The head of the lab, Prof Mario Caccamo told BBC News that he wants to use the technology to develop new varieties that can grow well in the hotter, drier conditions that the UK is experiencing more regularly, because of climate change.

""When we look to how the population is growing and how much we are increasing our yields using traditional methods, we are lagging behind,"" he said. ""The projections show that we have to have an acceleration into how we can improve crops otherwise we are going to be struggling to feed the world.""

A new variety of barley being tested by KWS plant breeders in Hertfordshire will take twelve years to come to market using conventional breeding techniques. The firm claims that gene editing will significantly reduce that time.

The UK is among the world leaders in research into plant genetics. But that expertise has not been able to take off, because of the effective ban on the commercial development of the technology"
30,", according to its supporters. The hope is that the change in law will attract new investment leading to new companies, new jobs and new foods.

Bayer Crop Science has developed GM crops for use across the world, employing more than 30,000 people.

But in the UK, it has a staff of 90 who are involved in traditional plant breeding. The company isn't ready to announce any new investment plans in England yet - but the firm's head of marketing in the UK, Lindy Blanchard, welcomed the change in the law.

""We are really, really excited and we are committed to help farmers overcome the challenges of climate change and we want to provide safe sustainable food for society, so no doubt we will be looking at this but it is step by step.""

The new act also has provision to allow gene-edited animals on English farms, like these disease resistant pigs, developed in Scotland. But that will require another vote by MPs in Westminster once the government is satisfied that animals won't suffer.

Raymond Beggs, from St Mark's High School in Warrenpoint, and Noreen Kelly from St Dallan's Primary School on a picket line

Teachers taking part in a strike that has closed most schools in Northern Ireland say they had no choice but industrial action.

Members of all five Northern Ireland teaching unions are on strike, mostly over a long-running pay dispute.

""Why is my labour worth so much less than it is in the rest of the UK when we have a world class education system?"" teacher Melanie Doherty asked.

She said teachers will leave Northern Ireland if they did not act.

Public service workers are also on strike with ports, MOT centres and courts affected.

Speaking before she joined the picket line with her colleagues at Foyle College in Londonderry, Ms Doherty told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster that she was ""downhearted"" but that teachers felt there was ""no other way"" to put their point across.

""We have a world class education system, but if we continue with the cuts and devaluing teachers we're not going to have that in Northern Ireland for much longer,"" she said.

For the first time, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is taking part in the full day's strike, joining four teaching unions who staged a previous walkout on 21 February.

The unions involved include the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (Nipsa) the civil servants union, along with members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (GMB), Unite and all the teachers' unions.

The action by the unions representing teachers is mainly due to a pay dispute, with a stalemate over a deal running for more than a year.

In February 2022, unions rejected a pay offer from employers for the years 2021-2023 as ""inadequate"".

Since then the cost of living has spiralled with inflation at more than 10%.

But with Stormont's education budget under severe pressure it is not clear how much money is available to make teachers a pay offer the unions would accept.

Members of the NASUWT (National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers) who work in further education (FE) colleges in Northern Ireland will, for the first time in the current dispute, join their colleagues on strike.

It is the first time in its 125-year history that members of the NAHT have taken strike action over pay.

Mark McTaggart, northern secretary for INTO (Irish National Teachers' Organisation), warned there would be a crisis in recruitment and retention of teachers in Northern Ireland.

""Teachers are significantly underpaid compared to every other teacher in these islands and schools across the north have no budgets in real terms,"" he told Good Morning Ulster.

""We are already talking about an education system which is half a billion pounds in debt - if there a 10% cut we are talking about £0.75bn debt.

""All that is going to lead to a reduction in the number of teachers in schools, which is going to have a devastating effect on the life chances of our young people across the north.""

The president of the Ulster Teachers' Union (UTU), Lynelle Fenton, said: ""I really don't think parents realise the cuts that are coming and the profound, potentially irreparable damage they will do to our education system, a system which until now has often been the envy of other parts of the UK.""

NASUWT members who work in further education (FE) colleges in Northern Ireland will, for the first time in the current dispute, also join their colleagues in schools in striking

​In a statement, a spokesperson for the five unions said their members had ""waited far too long for a satisfactory offer from the employers"".

""Teachers' pay, in real terms, has dropped by nearly a quarter in the 'lost decade' since the pay freeze of 2010-11,"" it added.

A large number of teachers in England are also due to strike on Thursday 27 April and Tuesday 2 May.

Further Education lecturers at the Belfast rally

Elsewhere, the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland has said its public services could be affected by industrial action by civil servants.

Strike action began with a walk-out at midnight from Larne and Belfast ports and government departments have all been affected.

Nipsa general secretary Carmel Gates said: ""Our members have had the worst pay offer of any group of workers on these islands.

""In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis the pay offer to civil servants was £552 for the year and that's before tax.

""This increase wouldn't even pay for their milk for the week.""

Members of Nipsa protest outside the Department for Communities offices in Belfast

Ms Gates said workers were being forced on to the bread line.

""Workers here have faced the worst pay award of any group on these island so it is essential that the secretary of state sets a budget that allows workers to get the pay rise they deserve,"" she said.

In a statement, the Department of Infrastructure said that as ""far as possible, contingency arrangements have been developed but the public are advised to expect disruption to many services as well as prioritisation of assistance to those incidents with most impact to life and property"".

The department said the Strangford ferry would not operate due to an ongoing strike and that there would be a significant reduction in its capacity to respond to flood emergencies should they occur.It said Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) test centres are expected to open but services may be affected.

Customers with booked appointments should attend as scheduled unless directly notified by the DVA not to attend.

The former prime minister has not handed over any messages from before April 2021 - more than a year into the pandemic

The government is likely to lose its legal case against the Covid inquiry, a government minister has said.

The Cabinet Office has said it will seek a judicial review of the inquiry's demand that it submit Boris Johnson's WhatsApp messages unredacted.

Science minister George Freeman told the BBC's Question Time he had ""very little doubt"" a court would find the documents should be handed over.

But, he added, it was ""worth testing"" if officials had a right to privacy.

On Thursday, the government missed a 16:00 BST deadline to submit messages sent between Mr Johnson and 40 other ministers and officials during the pandemic.

The Cabinet Office - which supports the prime minister in running the government - has argued many of the messages are not relevant, and that to hand them over would compromise ministers' privacy and hamper future decision-making.

Baroness Hallett, the retired judge and crossbench peer who is chairing the inquiry, has said it is up to her to decide what material is relevant.

Mr Johnson has said he has given his messages to the Cabinet Office and would be ""more than happy"" for them to be passed to the inquiry unredacted.

But the former prime minister has not handed over any messages from before April 2021 - more than a year into the pandemic - because his phone was involved in a security breach and has not been turned on since, his spokesman said.

In April 2021, it emerged that Mr Johnson's personal mobile phone number had been freely available on the internet for 15 years"
31,", leading to concerns over the device's security.

Mr Johnson has written to the Cabinet Office to ask whether technical support can be given so the content can be retrieved without compromising security, his spokesman added.

Documents released by the Cabinet Office also list questions put to Mr Johnson by the inquiry earlier this year, including: ""In or around autumn 2020, did you state that you would rather 'let the bodies pile high' than order another lockdown, or words to that effect? If so, please set out the circumstances in which you made these comments.""

The inquiry also asked the former prime minister if he received advice to sack Matt Hancock as health secretary between January and July 2020.

Asked about the government's legal case against the Covid inquiry, Mr Freeman told the BBC he thought the ""courts will probably take the view"" that Baroness Hallett is entitled to decide ""what evidence she deems relevant"".

But he added that ""people's privacy is really important"" and that the question of how private correspondence should be handled was a ""point worth testing"".

""I would like to see a situation where the inquiry says: 'Listen, we will wholly respect the privacy of anything that's not related to Covid. We will redact it',"" he said.

The challenge is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.

Dame Deirdre Hine, who led the review into the 2009 swine flu outbreak, said the government taking legal action would be ""most ill-advised"".

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think this is unwise on the part of the government and they have no right to withhold the documents.""

Lord Gavin Barwell, who worked as chief of staff to former prime minister Theresa May, said he thought the government was making a ""bad mistake"" by not handing over the full WhatsApp messages.

""We're having the enquiry to give people confidence we're getting to the truth. And if the government is controlling what the inquiry can and can't see, then people are not going to get confidence in the outcome,"" he told Today.

Relatives of the bereaved have expressed frustration at the government's stance

The saga comes just two weeks before the inquiry - tasked with identifying lessons from how the pandemic was handled - is due to hold its first public hearings.

Lobby Akinnola, from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, expressed exasperation at the government's decision to bring the challenge and said he feared it was part of an attempt to render the inquiry ""lame"".

""I'm frustrated, I'm angry,"" he told the BBC's The World Tonight, adding that ""we're trying to understand what went wrong so we can prevent it happening again and that... is what the government is hindering.""

Opposition parties have also urged the government to comply with the inquiry's requests.

Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described the legal challenge as a ""desperate attempt to withhold evidence"" that would serve ""only to undermine the Covid Inquiry"", while the Liberal Democrats called it a ""kick in the teeth for bereaved families who've already waited far too long for answers"".

A million people are without power across Ukraine after Russian missiles targeted energy infrastructure.

There is no electricity in the second-largest city of Kharkiv, the regional head says, and more than 53,000 households in Odesa are without power.

Ukraine's energy minister, German Galushchenko, accused Russia of trying to provoke ""a large-scale failure of the country's energy system"".

Russia said it was revenge for recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.

At least five people have been reported killed and 14 wounded.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said the latest wave of attacks showed that Western allies must give more military aid to Ukraine, including additional air defence systems.

""There are no delays in Russian missiles like there are in assistance to our country,"" he wrote on Telegram.

Some 90 missiles and 60 Shahed drones were launched into Ukraine during the wave of overnight attacks, he said.

Among the targets was Ukraine's largest dam - the DniproHES in Zaporizhzhia, which was hit eight times according to Ukrainian officials. Video footage appeared to show the dam on fire, but authorities say there is no threat of an imminent breach.

Officials also say that a trolleybus which was crossing the dam at the time caught fire after a missile strike, killing the driver.

""At 04:30 all hell broke loose. Terrible fireworks and explosions. At one point, our house tilted,"" Valentyna, an eyewitness whose house overlooks the dam told the BBC.

The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant lost connection to the main power line for almost five hours on Friday following the Russian attacks.

This highlighted the ""ever-present dangers to nuclear safety and security during the conflict"", it said.

The plant, however, continued to receive external electricity for reactor cooling from its only remaining back-up power line.

Regional head Ivan Fedorov said seven buildings in Zaporizhzhia had been destroyed and 35 others damaged.

Strikes were also reported in President Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rih and in Vinnytsia, both in central Ukraine. They damaged a ""critical infrastructure object"", said Ukrainian officials.

Russia's defence ministry said the assault on Ukraine's power grid was part of a series of revenge attacks against Kyiv for its earlier incursions into Russian territory.

Local officials in the Russian region of Belgorod, near the border with Ukraine, said on Thursday that a woman had been killed and many other people wounded by a Ukrainian strike.

The fresh attacks come a day after Russian forces launched one of their biggest air strikes in weeks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. At least 17 people, including a child, were injured by falling debris.

Attacks on the energy grid has been part of Russia's warfare against Ukraine since 2022.

Moscow has previously carried out strikes on Ukrainian power infrastructure plunging millions of people into darkness and depriving them of heat, power and water.

Attacks during the autumn and winter of 2022 left 17 million Ukrainians without a regular supply of electricity for extended periods.

But the head of the Ukrainian grid operator, Volodymyr Kudrytsky, said Thursday night's attacks were worse.

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system weren't so bad as last night. Dozens of grid facilities have been hit. This is on a global scale.""

Mr Kudrytsky added that the worst affected area was Kharkiv, where ""Russia literally tried to destroy all the main energy facilities feeding the city"".

President Zelensky has often described the Russian attacks on power stations as ""energy terrorism"".

The White House condemned Thursday's attacks and renewed its call for urgent additional air defences for Ukraine as soon as possible.

Earlier this month, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two top Russian commanders, accusing them of ordering attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

Australia retained the Women's Ashes with a dramatic three-run victory over England, who so nearly pulled off a remarkable victory through Nat Sciver-Brunt's masterful unbeaten century.

Sciver-Brunt, who scored 111 off 99 balls, dragged England from 203-7 to a position where they needed 15 runs from the last over and five off the final ball.

However, Australia and Jess Jonassen, who bowled the final over, held their nerve to retain the urn with one match to spare by virtue of being the holders.

The points-based series, which is now 8-6 in favour of Australia, concludes at Taunton on Tuesday.

Australia owe plenty to number eight batter Georgia Wareham, who smashed 26 from the last over of the tourists' innings, bowled by Lauren Bell, to drag them from 240-7 with three overs remaining.

"
32,"While it was a match-defining over, England were also left to rue another sloppy performance in the field, dropping all-rounder Ellyse Perry three times in her innings of 91.

In the second ODI at Bristol, England levelled the series with their highest-ever run chase and were set the task of breaking that record again to keep their hopes alive once more.

England started positively, with opener Tammy Beaumont continuing her fine form with 60 from 62 balls before Australia's spinners once again proved the difference.

All seven England wickets fell to spin as leg-spinner Alana King and off-spinner Ash Gardner took three each to unravel the middle order.

Sciver-Brunt stood firm with a chanceless knock, her third unbeaten century in her past four ODI innings against Australia, but she slumped to her knees in devastation as she could only manage a single from the final ball.

England can still draw the series with a win in the final ODI, but were visibly distraught by the defeat having dragged themselves back into contention after Australia initially raced into a 6-0 lead in the points-based series.

In the 2022 World Cup final Sciver-Brunt hit a sublime 148 not out in England's pursuit of a mammoth 356 against the same opponents.

There were echoes of the same innings at Southampton: Australia favourites, but England's talismanic all-rounder standing between them and glory.

At 144-5, few had hopes of an England comeback, as ruthless Australia reverted to their best - which has been absent throughout the series.

But Sciver-Brunt found company in Amy Jones, who scored 37 in a stand of 57, until the game tilted back towards the visitors when Jones and Sophie Ecclestone departed in the same Gardner over.

She then found perhaps more unlikely company in Sarah Glenn, who played her number nine role expertly as she nudged and nurdled her way to 22 from 35 balls to give England hope, needing 21 from the last two overs.

Sciver-Brunt found the boundary at key moments to keep England in the game, and her fitness allowed her to run singles and twos between the wickets against Australia's incredible fielders.

As England's star player, there is more pressure on Sciver-Brunt and there were signs she was feeling it, without a half-century in the white-ball series until now.

She saved her best for when it mattered most, with the Ashes on the line, but once again fell cruelly short and had to watch even more jubilant Australian celebrations.

Spin the difference as Australia serve reminder of class

Australia's spinners have been excellent throughout the series, even in defeat, but it has actually been a rare triumph for them.

England have attacked them, and unsettled their usual dominance, and it has shown in the performances with the bat, in the field and from the seamers.

A brave selection call was made, dropping pacer Darcie Brown for another spinner in King, and it proved pivotal.

King bowled with variation, deception of pace and changed the game with a beautiful turning delivery to bowl Beaumont and disrupt England's free-flowing scoring.

Gardner has had a phenomenal series, kick-started by her eight wickets in the Test, while Jonassen showed all her experience to expertly close out the game.

They also corrected their mistakes in the field, exemplified by Phoebe Litchfield's stunning full-length dive to turn a boundary into two runs, which may not have looked significant at the time but given the margin of victory, it was crucial.

England once again fought so bravely, but were ultimately edged out by moments of greatness.

'We showed all our grit and determination' - what they said

Australia captain Alyssa Healy: ""It was a really, really good game of cricket. Both sides really hung in there and Nat Sciver-Brunt, yet again, played an incredible innings - I thought she was going to take it away from us at the end.

""But full credit to our girls, they showed all their grit and determination again and we got ourselves over the line.

""To know that the Ashes are coming home with us is hugely exciting.""

England captain Heather Knight on BBC Test Match Special: ""It's been a ridiculous series, and has to go down as the best ever in history.

""How Nat played to get so close was brilliant. To nearly chase down that total was really good.

""Our focus now is to win both white-ball series. We're gutted we weren't able to keep the momentum.""

Ex-Australia batter Alex Blackwell on TMS: ""I haven't seen a tighter series between these two, it's been outstanding. England should be very, very proud. They were 6-0 down after the first T20 and they found a way to level it.""

Relations between Beijing and Washington have plummeted in recent years

The US and China have pledged to stabilise their tense relationship following US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's two-day visit to Beijing.

Mr Blinken met China's President Xi Jinping for talks on Monday, restarting high-level communications between the rival superpowers.

Mr Xi said they had made progress, while Mr Blinken indicated that both sides were open to further talks.

But the top US diplomat made clear that there remained major differences.

""I stressed that... sustained communication at senior levels is the best way to responsibly manage differences and ensure that competition does not veer into conflict,"" Mr Blinken told reporters after the 35-minute meeting at the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.

""I heard the same from my Chinese counterparts,"" he said. ""We both agree on the need to stabilise our relationship.""

But Mr Blinken, 61, said he was ""clear-eyed"" about China and there were ""many issues on which we profoundly - even vehemently - disagree"".

Relations between Beijing and Washington have plummeted in the wake of a Trump-era trade war, Beijing's assertive claims over Taiwan and the shooting down of an alleged Chinese spy balloon over the US earlier this year.

Mr Blinken's visit is the first by a top US diplomat in almost five years.

Discussions between him and Mr Xi included everything from Russia's war in Ukraine and America's fentanyl crisis to Taiwan, North Korea and alleged human rights abuses by China, the US state department said.

And although there were no clear breakthroughs, Mr Xi suggested relations could be moving in a positive direction.

""The two sides have also made progress and reached agreement on some specific issues,"" he said, in a transcript of his remarks released by the US state department. ""This is very good.""

The meeting with Mr Xi was not originally on Mr Blinken's schedule and was announced just an hour before it took place.

It would have been widely viewed as a snub had it not happened, however, especially since Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates met Mr Xi in Beijing earlier this week.

Instead, the Americans will be able to point to the secretary's visit - which also included meetings with China's top diplomat Wang Yi and Foreign Minister Qin Gang - as a successful re-engagement with the Chinese government after months of frosty relations.

US President Joe Biden and officials in Washington have said they view the Chinese as rivals and competitors and not adversaries. It is a fine line to walk, however, as the competition - both militarily and economically - heats up.

With the meeting, Mr Xi was also sending a message to his own people that his government was reaching out to Washington.

Taiwan is the biggest area of contention between the two countries and the one that has the highest potential of escalating.

China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province and Mr Xi has indicated that he wishes to bring"
33,"Taiwan under Beijing's control during his term in office.

However, Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland with its own constitution and leaders. US President Joe Biden said last year that the US would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack from China, a move condemned by Beijing.

But on Monday, Mr Blinken again stressed that Washington does not support Taiwan independence, adding that he sought to ""disabuse"" China of the notion the US is ""seeking to economically contain them"".

He said China gave some assurances too. It again stressed that it would not supply lethal aid to Russia to use in Ukraine, but Mr Blinken shared concerns about private Chinese companies aiding Russia's military.

However, China knocked back a US proposal to restart communication channels between the countries' militaries - a key objective of the talks.

While the trip yielded no great progress - as was expected - when concluding his news conference, Mr Blinken said he hoped it signalled better communication in the future.

""Progress is hard. It takes time. And it's not the product of one visit, one trip, one conversation,"" he said.

Up to quarter of a million operations and appointments could be postponed due to next week's junior doctors' strike, the NHS Confederation warns.

Patients are likely to see more of an impact because the four-day walkout comes after the Easter weekend, said Dr Layla McCay, director of policy at the health bosses' confederation.

Health bosses ""are more concerned about this than they have been about any other strike"", she said.

The walkout is due to start on Tuesday.

Hospital bosses have said they cannot guarantee patients will be safe as managers struggle to arrange staffing during the strike, which will affect both emergency and planned care.

The British Medical Association (BMA) says it will not exempt any services but that there are plans to protect patients, which could involve pulling junior doctors off the picket line if individual hospitals report lives are in immediate danger.

It is calling for a 35% pay rise to make up for 15 years of below-inflation wage rises.

Dr McCay told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""In the last junior doctors' strike, we saw about 175,000 appointments and operations having to be postponed.

""In terms of the disruption that we're anticipating this time, we reckon it could be up to about a quarter of a million so that is a huge amount of impact for patients up and down the country.

The walkout will be from 07:00 BST on Tuesday to 07:00 BST on Saturday. During last month's strike, hospitals drafted in consultants to provide cover but it is estimated a quarter of them are on leave due to the Easter holidays.

""With the junior doctors out for the four days, but those four days being bookmarked either side by the Easter weekend and another weekend, the disruption is going to go on for 10 or 11 days,"" said Dr McCay.

""What we expect to see is really significant diminished capacity within the health service.""

On health leaders' fears about the strikes, she added: ""They think the impact is going to be so significant that this one is likely to have impact on patient safety, and that is a huge concern for every healthcare leader.""

Postponements are likely so that hospitals can focus on the most urgent and life-threatening cases, said Dr McCay.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay has been urged to meet union representatives over the bank holiday weekend to try to resolve the issue.

Dr Vivek Trivedi, co-director of the junior doctors' committee at the BMA, said they want to be sure Mr Barclay ""is serious about pay erosion"" - but added he is yet to put a credible offer on the table.

""All we're asking for is a credible offer that shows us he's serious, that we can start a path of negotiations to try to address the real-terms pay cut,"" he said.

The Department of Health and Social Care has said the BMA has to call off the strike for any negotiations to take place.

It says the government is working with NHS England to put contingency plans in place to protect patient safety during the strike.

""The NHS will prioritise resources to protect emergency treatment, critical care, maternity and neonatal care, and trauma,"" a spokesman said.

Late on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) convened a meeting for a group of international journalists at the defence ministry building in Tel Aviv. The IDF then set out for us the results of their initial inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza.

Retired Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even described how the IDF's drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the World Central Kitchen vehicles with a missile.

The IDF then described how two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone.

The military confirmed that there were survivors from the second explosion, who managed to get into the third vehicle - which was then also hit by a missile.

By the end, all the aid workers were dead.

The IDF's investigation concluded that the army unit involved had believed the vehicles they were tracking from the sky had been taken over by Hamas gunmen, and that they were not aware of the coordination procedures put in place between the military and World Central Kitchen for that evening.

It also said they also did not know the cars belonged to the charity, and the three air strikes were in violation of the army's own procedures.

Three of the charity's cars were struck during the attack

The evidence from the investigation has been passed to the Military Advocate General - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there has been any criminal conduct.

In addition, the army has sacked the major in charge of fire support. The brigade's chief of staff, a colonel, has also been sacked. The divisional commander, brigade commander and the general in charge of the IDF's Southern Command have been formally reprimanded.

The IDF sought to explain the context leading up to the fatal events of that evening.

The aid workers had been overseeing the distribution of food aid that had arrived on a ship from Cyprus and unloaded at a recently constructed jetty in the northern Gaza strip. Under coordination with the IDF, the World Central Kitchen team were transferring these supplies to a warehouse a few kilometres further south.

During this process, the IDF says their drone operators spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry that was being escorted by the WCK team. They played those of us at the briefing a somewhat blurry video - which has not been released to the public - showing a figure holding a gun, on top of the lorry. At one point the gun is fired, showing up clearly on the slowed-down black and white footage.

At this stage the military contacts World Central Kitchen but they are in turn unable to reach the team on the ground - where phone communication is patchy and aid agencies say they are prohibited by the IDF from using radios.

The drone footage also appears to confirm that at night, the stickers on the roof of the World Central Kitchen vehicles, with the charity's logo, are not visible to the drone operator.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: US says Israel must make changes in the coming ""hours and days""

The military then tracks the convoy, including the aid lorry, to a warehouse. Then the convoy splits - the aid lorry remains in the warehouse and four SUV-type cars emerge. One of those vehicles heads north, and is then shown to contain gunmen, with weapons clearly visible from the drone footage, as they emerge next to another aid warehouse. The IDF say that these gunmen were not target"
34,"ed, because of their proximity to an aid facility.

Meanwhile, three remaining vehicles belonging to World Central Kitchen begin to head south.

The drone team, the army says, now working under the assumption that they are dealing with Hamas militants and not an aid convoy, had misidentified one of the aid workers as a gunman, and claimed to have seen them enter one of the three WCK cars.

No footage of this moment was provided, but the military investigation concluded that it was a ""misclassification... they saw that it's a rifle but at the end of the day it was a bag"".

Under the mistaken belief that one vehicle now contained a gunman, authorisation to fire a missile is sought, and granted by superior officers. At 23:09 the first vehicle is struck, two minutes later the second, and at 23:13 the third final, fatal strike is launched.

The military's conclusions are that three major failings occurred:

The house met its auction guide price of £1.5m

A house on the Thames in south east London, which has long been the subject of local intrigue, has sold for £1.5m.

The property, said to be known as the ""leaning tower of Rotherhithe"", is four storeys high and 3.5m wide. It was purchased by a buyer from the area.

Savills lot negotiator Steven Morish said: ""Auction works really well for quirky lots like this.

""The value in this is an art rather than a science; the buyers will set the value.""

The house, which was once part of a row of buildings, has a run-down exterior but still attracted ""a really good level of interest"" from across the globe.

The row as it looked before World War Two. The house is to the right of ""H. Pocock""

The house boasts views of the City

The building, now 1 Fulford Street, was formerly 41 Rotherhithe Street. Now the only house on the street, it was once surrounded by shipping businesses.

To the west of the property, the buildings were destroyed during the Blitz in World War Two.

In the 1960s, London County Council bought the remaining houses on the row but the owners of 41 Rotherhithe Street, barge constructors Braithwaite & Dean, refused to sell.

The company employed lightermen - workers who used flat-bottomed barges to move goods between ships and quays - and they would pull up to collect their wages from the premises.

Savills said it believed the buyer intended to live in the house. The former owners sold up as they were said to no longer require a London bolthole.

The four-storey property had been in the same hands for 28 years

The house has several bedrooms

Queen Elizabeth II's funeral and events during the period of national mourning cost the government an estimated £162m, the Treasury has said.

The state funeral on 19 September 2022 came 11 days after her death.

During that period of national mourning hundreds of thousands of people visited Westminster where she was lying in state.

The Home Office (£74m) and Department of Culture, Media and Sport (£57m) spent the most.

The costs incurred by the government departments relate to the Queen's funeral and other events in the run-up, including the monarch's lying-in-state.

John Glen, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government's priority at the time had been to make sure ""these events ran smoothly and with the appropriate level of dignity, while at all times ensuring the safety and security of the public"".

In a written ministerial statement made to Parliament, Mr Glen said the Treasury had provided additional funding where necessary and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments were ""fully"" refunded for their respective costs.

After Queen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022 aged 96, the UK started 10 days of national mourning.

The late Queen's coffin was laid to rest in St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh for 24 hours, before the monarch was taken to Westminster Abbey in London where thousands of mourners queued for hours to pay their respects.

People lined up in London at all hours of the day, often in chilly temperatures, to pay their respects - including David Beckham.

The wait time at one stage was estimated to be more than 24 hours; and the queue snaked from Westminster Hall, down along the River Thames and stretched south for almost seven miles (11km).

The scale of the state funeral and mourning arrangements led to what police described at the time as ""probably the biggest operation we're likely to launch in the UK"".

Queen Elizabeth II's coffin being carried out of Westminster Abbey

World leaders and foreign royalty joined the Royal Family for the state funeral at Westminster Abbey.

Members of the 2,000-strong congregation included the Queen's great-grandchildren, the prime minister at the time Liz Truss and US President Joe Biden and his wife Jill.

The event was watched by millions of people across the country and around the world.

It was the first state funeral since Sir Winston Churchill's in 1965 and the biggest ceremonial event since World War Two.

After the funeral, the Queen's coffin travelled in a procession to Wellington Arch and then on to its final journey to Windsor Castle and a committal service.

Queen Elizabeth II's death was followed by 10 days of national mourning

The cost was used to facilitate the smooth running of the event and ensure mourners from the UK and across the world could visit and take part safely, Downing Street has said.

""Of course, a major international event of this scale, we wanted to ensure that we could enable people to pay their respects,"" a No 10 spokesman added.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has faced calls to be more open about his financial affairs

Rishi Sunak paid more than £1m in UK tax over the last three years, details of the prime minister's financial affairs show.

The UK tax was paid on earnings of more than £4.7m from income and a US-based investment fund.

Mr Sunak first said he would publish a tax return during his unsuccessful campaign to be Tory leader last year.

He faced calls to be transparent about his finances after it emerged his wife, Akshata Murty, had non-dom status.

The tax details came as MPs questioned former Prime Minister Boris Johnson over whether he misled Parliament over Partygate.

Mr Sunak is thought to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament and his personal wealth is something opposition parties have often used as a political attack line.

The PM worked in finance before entering politics and he and his family are thought to own several properties, including a Grade II-listed manor house in his North Yorkshire constituency.

In the last financial year alone, 2021-2022, the prime minister earned more than £1.9m in income and capital gains, according to the records.

Capital gains are taxed at 20% in the UK, while the highest income tax band is 45% on earnings over £150,000.

The records show the total UK tax he paid was:

Nimesh Shah, chief executive of tax advisory firm Blick Rothenberg, pointed out that Mr Sunak only released a summary of his income and gains, rather than a traditional tax return filed with HM Revenue & Customs.

""Whilst the public knows more now than it did before the release, it doesn't show the full picture,"" he said.

Mr Shah said the supporting notes from Mr Sunak's accountants ""give an explanation of how his tax position is made, rather than it being left to interpretation of his tax returns"".

""The release is a fairly controlled way of publishing his tax information.""

Earlier this month, during a trip to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Sunak said he had been too ""busy"" to publish sooner.

Labour said it was right Mr Sunak had published his tax returns ""after much delay"".

The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""They reveal a tax system designed by successive Tory governments"
35,"in which the prime minister pays a far lower tax rate than working people who face the highest tax burden in 70 years.""

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he hoped to be able to publish his tax returns on Thursday.

The Liberal Democrats said Mr Sunak ""snuck"" the records out ""whilst the world is distracted with Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling"".

""People will be much more concerned today about the staggering tax hikes Rishi Sunak has imposed on them,"" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson Christine Jardine said.

Mr Sunak said he was glad to publish his tax return ""in the interests of transparency"".

Asked on a visit to north Wales if, given his wealth, he could understand what it is like for people struggling to heat their homes, Mr Sunak said: ""Ultimately what people are interested in is what I'm going to do for them.""

Pointing to government support with energy bills, he said tackling the cost of living was his ""number one priority"".

While there is not a long tradition of prime ministers publishing their tax returns, some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have chosen to do so in recent years.

Former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron published his tax return in 2016 after revelations about his late father's offshore fund were revealed in the Panama Papers.

Theresa May released her tax return during her campaign to be Tory leader in 2016, but did not do so when she was prime minister.

The two previous prime ministers, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, did not publish their tax returns.

The financial affairs of Mr Sunak and his family were thrust into the media spotlight when he was chancellor in 2022.

Mr Sunak's wife, Ms Murty, revealed she had non-dom status, which meant she did not pay UK tax on her overseas earnings.

Ms Murty is the daughter the billionaire founder of Indian IT giant Infosys and owns a share of the company, entitling her to dividend payments.

As Mr Sunak came under political pressure, Ms Murty released a statement saying she would pay UK tax on her overseas income but retain her non-dom status.

At about the same time, Mr Sunak admitted he had held a US green card - allowing permanent residence in that country - while he was chancellor.

He returned the green card in October 2021, ahead of his first trip to the US as a UK government minister.

Following these revelations, Mr Sunak referred himself to the prime minister's ethics adviser, who cleared him of breaching ministerial rules over the declaration of his financial arrangements.

The document released by the government includes an explanation of the prime minister's tax affairs from 2019.

The document says all of Mr Sunak's investment income and capital gains ""relate to a single US-based investment fund"", which is listed as a ""blind management arrangement"" on the register of ministers' interests.

Politicians with share portfolios and investments routinely set up blind trusts when they get government jobs. This allows them to continue earning income from their investments without knowing where the money is invested to avoid any conflicts of interest.

The document says ""some of the income of the US-based investment fund is also subject to tax in other jurisdictions (including the USA)"".

Mr Sunak is thought to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament

Mr Sunak - who has previously worked as an analyst for the investment bank, Goldman Sachs - has acknowledged that his investments are kept in a financial arrangement known as a blind trust.

In February, in an interview with TalkTV presenter Piers Morgan, he was asked whether it was right for prime ministers to have blind trusts.

Mr Sunak said: ""I think that's better than them having control over them.""

Mr Sunak's records also show that the prime minister paid tax in the US on dividends in the country. A dividend is a sum of money paid by a company to its shareholders out of its profits.

""These US dividends were also subject to tax in the UK,"" the document says.

The document says Mr Sunak's previously held green card status did not impact his tax liability in either the UK or the US during the three financial years reported.

Shekhar Kapur says Hollywood's push to cast actors of colour comes from guilt

Director Shekhar Kapur has said Hollywood's push for more diverse casts has come from its guilt over ""all the actors who are not getting work"".

Kapur said the inclusion of ethnic minority actors in shows such as Netflix's Bridgerton is ""a good thing"" in terms of opportunity.

But, he said, it hides ""a greater, more fundamental issue"" of which stories are brought to the big screen.

He added the rise in protests had helped bring the issue to the fore.

""Hollywood should be telling stories of that culture, of the culture of the brown people, of the African-American people, of the black people, of Asians,"" he told BBC Newsnight's Sima Kotecha.

""But what's happening is they're still addicted to their, you know, the narrative is still their point of view.""

Kapur is best known for his films Elizabeth and its sequel The Golden Age, both starring Cate Blanchett, and Bollywood films such as Mr India and Bandit Queen.

When asked about Hollywood's efforts to increase the diversity of actors in its films, Kapur described it as ""a guilt trip"" and woke.

""It's Hollywood feeling guilty about all the actors that are not getting work. And because there's a huge rise of protests,"" he said.

The live-action remake of The Little Mermaid released in cinemas in May starred black actress and singer Halle Bailey as main character Ariel, which caused controversy in some quarters.

Halle Bailey starred in Disney's live-action remake of The Little Mermaid earlier this year

Kapur joined the film industry in India as an actor, before going on to become a director.

His 1998 film Elizabeth, about the early years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, received widespread critical acclaim and several Oscar nominations.

Following its release, the director said many of the scripts he received went on to be ""a huge success"", including ones that he turned down.

Discussing international scripts he would receive, he said: ""It's always an American going in, fixing the world's problem, going to Africa... and I said, 'Don't send me those scripts because it's not true'.

Kapur was educated in Delhi before moving to London for a career as a management consultant and chartered accountant

""For example, if you were going to make Gandhi the answer, the question was: 'Who's the American in it? Who's the American who goes and fixes all the problems? And who's the white man in the film?'

""And I would refuse to do those films. Absolutely. Because it's not patently not true.""

Kapur was educated in Delhi before moving to London for a career as a management consultant and chartered accountant, but later turned to film directing, releasing his first film Masoom in 1983.

The 77-year-old, whose most recent film What's Love Got To Do With It? starred Shazad Latif and Lily James, suggested the film industry is contained within far too small a geographical area.

""I really believe that Hollywood's too concentrated together as like a group,"" he said. ""I think it needs to be taken away and spread out.

""I would love to see it in Shanghai if you can. I would love to see it in Mumbai or in Tokyo or as it's happening in Seoul.""

Ms Frendo said Saul ""always had the biggest infectious smile and was full of love""

A teenager who died when his e-bike collided with an ambulance after he was followed by police was ""the most sweetest, kindest boy ever"", his mother has said.

Saul Cookson, 15, was being followed by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) traffic officers in Salford on Thursday until bollards blocked their vehicle's path.

His e-bike then collided with the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) vehicle.

Emma Frendo said her son had been ""loved by all that met him"".

""He was the sweetest, most kindest boy ever, and always had the"
36,"biggest infectious smile and was full of love,"" she said.

""Saul was a much-loved son, brother, grandson, and nephew, loved by all that met him.""

The Independent Office for Police Conduct has begun an investigation into Thursday's collision

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said an investigation into the collision.

It said Saul had been riding a black off-road Sur-Ron e-bike and was followed by officers along Fitzwarren Street and on to Lower Seedley Road at about 14:00 BST before the crash on Langworthy Road.

While not on an active call at the time of the crash, NWAS said its vehicle was being driven back to a nearby ambulance station.

Its crew were immediately able to treat the boy before taking him to hospital, where he later died.

Police and independent investigators have been examining the scene of the crash

Writing on Facebook, Taylor-Jade Cookson paid tribute to her brother and said ""words cannot describe my feelings at the moment"".

""Rest in peace Saul I love you,"" she added.

Dozens of people have been leaving flowers and cards at the scene.

Two sapphire blue, heart-shaped balloons have been tied at the foot of a lamppost, along with flowers, candles, cards and a large white banner full of handwritten messages.

Another, circled with red hearts, simply reads ""Gone but not forgotten"".

One of Saul's relatives who attended the scene to lay flowers said the family was ""a mess"" following their loss.

Saul's friend, 21-year-old Mitchell Murden, said he had been due to meet him on the day he died.

He described Saul as ""a good lad"" who ""kept himself to himself"".

Family friend Jacob Bailey said ""no-one had a bad word to say"" about Saul

Family friend Jacob Bailey, 19, told BBC Newsbeat he came to lay some flowers and pay his respects as he had ""known Saul since I was about five"".

""He was just one of those proper nice kids,"" he said.

""He never ever caused anyone any harm.

""No-one had a bad word to say about Saul.""

Neighbour Karen Cosgrove said she had passed the scene at about 14:30 BST on Thursday and saw Saul lying on the ground.

""I walked away, I could barely look at it,"" she said.

""His mum was there, she was screaming.

Heartfelt messages have been left at the crash scene

Some concerns have been expressed by local people about the availability and use of high-powered e-bikes.

Mr Murden said ""the majority"" of young people in the area had them.

Mike McCusker, lead member for transport at Salford City Council, said there was ""growing concern"" in the community about e-bikes, particularly ""very young men riding round without helmets on"".

""The ones we have on our loan schemes are limited to about 15mph, but there are unregulated ones that can go up to speeds of 60mph.

""We don't think regulation is keeping track with the technological advancements around e-bikes.""

Flowers and candles have also been left at the scene

In a statement, GMP said: ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the boy who tragically died.""

The IOPC said it had begun gathering evidence, including dashcam footage from the police vehicle, and had taken initial statements from two police officers, who were being treated as witnesses.

A representative said there was ""no indication at this early time... of direct physical contact between the police vehicle and the e-bike"", but examinations of both were ""continuing"".

IOPC regional director Catherine Bates said it was ""important we understand the events leading up to this incident and will be looking at the actions and decision-making of police prior to the collision, including the reason for the decision to follow the bike"".

She asked anyone who witnessed or had dashcam footage of the collision or ""events leading up to it"" to get in touch.

• None Teen on e-bike dies after being followed by police

As well as rising numbers of post-Covid illnesses, those suffering from mental health and back issues account for many on long-term sick

""Written off"" and ""ashamed"" - this is how one woman described the experience of being on long-term sick leave.

Emma - not her real name - from north Wales, said she wanted to return to work but had lost her self-esteem and confidence.

It comes as official data shows those not working due to long-term sickness remain at record levels in the UK.

The Welsh government said it was working to help people with ill health back into employment.

Emma has been away from her healthcare role since contracting Covid and said she felt ashamed about not being able to return to her job.

She said: ""I feel written off. I feel a lot of it was blamed on mental health.""I was told that I should be mindful and getting out in the fresh air, which felt very patronising.""

Emma said she believed that if her employer were to make some changes, she would be able to return to her role.

""I was told I'd need to complete a high number of hours on my first week of return - not all illnesses can accommodate strict policy,"" she said.

Nicola Allen has recently returned to work with a friend's company

Nicola Allen from Whitchurch, Cardiff, started experiencing health issues during pregnancy and was later diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.

""I always had the plan that I would return to work when my son was in school full-time, but that didn't happen,"" she said.

Nicola had worked in London for many years as an assistant buyer for a popular high street clothes shop.

After about eight years out of work, Nicola was recently offered a part-time employment opportunity through a friend's company.

She said: ""My previous career was demanding so I was nervous, but they were clear they wanted me, as me - and they understood my conditions.

""I even told them I was frightened, because I didn't want to let them down, or myself down.""

The support Nicola is given means she can manage her health as and when she needs to.

She said she felt more confident as a result.

""Long-term sick doesn't mean we don't want to work, we do - we're just unfortunately not being given the opportunities that work with our illnesses,"" she said.

About 2.5 million people in the UK are not working due to health problems, the Office for National Statistics said.

It said an increase in mental health issues and people suffering back pain, possibly due to home working, were the main causes of the rise.

Typically, for every 13 people currently working, one person is long-term sick.

""Figures had started going up before the pandemic but that trend continued into the pandemic and accelerated in 2021 to reach a record high,"" said David Freeman, head of labour markets and household at the Office of National Statistics.

He said there had been a change in types of illnesses - including post-viral fatigue ""which could be linked to long-Covid"". He also described rising cases of people affected by back and mental health issues.

Head of Wales at Federation of Small Businesses, Ben Cottam, said: ""Illness costs businesses financially across the UK £5 billion a year, so there is a definite economic impact, which is why we'd like to see government-targeted intervention.""

In a statement, the Welsh government said: ""We are working to help people suffering with ill-health back into work. Our plan for employability and skills prioritises people most in need of help.

""This includes supporting people to stay in"
37,"work and those further away from the labour market to find employment.

""Furthermore, in February 2023, we announced the Out of Work Service to support 10,500 people recovering from mental ill-health and/ or substance misuse into education, training or work by March 2025.""

The Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We know for many people there are significant benefits to being in work, including for their wellbeing. We're investing £3.5 billion to help millions, including those with long-term illness, to start, stay and succeed in work.

""Our plan is working - inactivity in Wales has fallen since last quarter - but for those who can't return to work yet, employers can choose to pay more occupational sick pay for longer, while Universal Credit provides a strong financial safety net for those needing extra support.""

Labour needs to be ""bolder"" and ""more ambitious"", rather than ""tinkering around the edges"", the head of the UK's second largest union has told the BBC.

Unite leader Sharon Graham warned that otherwise ""apathy"" would be the winner at the next general election.

The union gives more money to Sir Keir Starmer's party than any other.

Ms Graham saw off a bid this week by some members to end Unite's affiliation to Labour, which guarantees the party nearly £1.5m a year.

She argued it would be the worst time to leave the Labour Party when it was ""within touching distance of power, because that would reduce union influence"".

Ms Graham's membership spans public and private sectors, so what influence does she want to exercise?

Next Saturday, Labour's National Policy Forum meets behind closed doors in Nottingham.

It brings together trade union representatives with MPs, grassroots members, and some shadow ministers.

Although any policies agreed there are not guaranteed to be included in the next election manifesto, trade unions can make very clear where their priorities lie.

For Unite, taking energy companies and the struggling steel industry into public ownership are near the top of its agenda.

During a number of meetings with the Labour leadership, Ms Graham has pressed her case that it would be cheaper to buy a steel industry that has lost much of its market value, than to bail out its private owners.

The Labour leader was publicly urged to do this when he spoke at Unite's policy conference in Brighton this week.

But while he has talked of ""preserving"" the industry if Labour wins power, he would not commit to acquiring it for the state.

Ms Graham is now intending to take a less conventional approach to policy-making.

The plan is for ""hundreds of organisers"" to go to marginal seats and talk to voters there about the case for taking key industries into public hands.

The message will be reinforced by Unite-funded billboards.

The hope is that then voters will press local Labour parties and local candidates to commit to backing nationalisation.

""We will take our ideas to the people,"" Ms Graham told me.

""The real decision-makers are the voters. If they push those ideas, politicians tend to move when they speak to voters.""

Her over-arching criticism is that Labour's leadership is not setting out a distinctive enough alternative to the government, and feels too constrained by the state of the economy.

She argued that ""we need be as bold as the 1945 Labour government"" which created the NHS. ""There wasn't much money about then, I can tell you,"" she said.

The next Labour government could leave a lasting legacy, she suggested.

""People will say they remember when energy companies were privatised and when they paid massive bills, and it was a Labour government that stopped all that.""

The Labour leadership would argue that unless the party is trusted on the economy, many of the things trade unions want - like increased employment rights - simply won't happen.

Its strategists also believe that it has to be seen to be moving away from Corbyn-era policies to win back voters who abandoned the party in 2019.

But Ms Graham told me that abiding strictly by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves's ""fiscal rules"" had led to ""inertia"", and people were beginning to ask: ""What's the difference?"" between government and opposition.

""If Labour are saying what's happening now is awful, and it is absolutely awful, they have to come out with solutions to that.""

While Labour is criticising the number of children in poverty, its shadow ministers have been told they can't commit, for example, to provide free school meals for all primary children, because that would be a spending commitment.

Ms Graham said the party must ""talk about what they can do to change Britain. People want something to vote for.""

She told her members this week that maintaining Unite's financial link to Labour would give her ""maximum leverage"" with the party.

But so far she hasn't moved policy on energy and steel. So by guaranteeing funds to Sir Keir Starmer, wasn't she actually reducing her bargaining power?

""The affiliation fee is what you pay to be part of the club. But most of the money we gave Labour traditionally was outside the affiliation fee,"" she said.

For example, the union donated an additional £3m to Labour before the last election.

But Ms Graham warned there were ""no blank cheques"".

""I want to see some movement if we are going to give what we usually give... We would be better off with a Labour government, but I am very, very disappointed with the lack of ambition.""

A large tree has fallen in Killyleagh, County Down

Fallen trees and power outages have caused disruption across Northern Ireland during Storm Kathleen.

A yellow warning for strong winds ended at 22:00 BST, with the strongest gusts recorded reaching 69mph in County Down.

Some flights - including all Aer Lingus services at Belfast City Airport - and ferry sailings were cancelled.

For the second time this year, part of the roof of Titanic Belfast was damaged by strong winds.

The Met Office had warned of possible travel disruption, power cuts, and a risk of injuries from large waves.

Similar weather warnings were also issued in the Republic of Ireland.

A spokesperson said Titanic Belfast visitor centre was shut on Saturday afternoon and would remain closed on Sunday as a ""precautionary measure"".

""Due to the ongoing inclement weather, access to the roof to assess the damage is limited and remedial works can not yet begin to take place,"" they said.

Pre-booked customers are to be refunded, with the attraction expected to re-open on Monday.

It had previously been impacted by Storm Isha in January.

Fallen trees, downed power lines and some flooding also led to the closure of a number of roads including:

Stena Line cancelled four sailings between Belfast and Cairnryan on Saturday due to the adverse weather.

A 19:30 sailing from Cairnryan to Belfast has also been delayed.

Stena Line services between Dublin and Holyhead were also cancelled.

""It was a rollercoaster ride to be honest, I think I was at Blackpool Pleasure Beach,"" he told BBC News NI.

Jonathan Pankhurst's flight from London's Heathrow was diverted to Belfast International on Saturday

NIE Networks said about 750 customers have been left without power after high winds caused ""a low level of damage to the electricity network"".

""Our teams are working to repair any damage caused and restore power as quickly as possible,"" a"
38,"spokesperson added.

In the Republic of Ireland, 12,000 homes, farms and businesses were left without electricity by Storm Kathleen.

ESB Networks said the largest outages were in counties Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Laois and Wicklow.

A spokesman said crews aim to restore supply power to the ""vast majority"" on Saturday evening, however some would be without power overnight.

""We apologise to all homes, farms and businesses impacted for the inconvenience caused,"" he said.

The colourful houses of Whitehead were sprayed by the waves on Saturday morning

Stormont departments had advised people not to visit forests, country parks or nature reserves in the affected areas and to be careful when driving.

The Stormont Estate was also closed as a precaution while vehicle access to forests, including for caravanning and camping, was also suspended for the duration of the weather warning.

Travellers have been advised to check providers for updates.

The strongest wind was recorded at 69mph (111 km/h) at Orlock Head in County Down.

As of noon on Saturday, other strong winds were recorded at:

The Department for Infrastructure said on Friday that ""multi-agency partners including the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland), NIE (Northern Ireland Electricity), the Department for Infrastructure and other emergency response and public sector organisations have met to prepare for Storm Kathleen"".

Belfast City Council said due to the weather conditions, all grass pitches at Victoria Park, Cherryvale, Wedderburn and Strangford would be closed.

Mark Drakeford has been Welsh Labour leader since 2018

In an emotional speech to his party First Minister Mark Drakeford has said his grief losing his wife will not stop his work for Labour.

Close to tears, the Welsh party leader thanked those who showed him kindness after his wife Clare died in January.

He also called for Sir Keir Starmer to ditch first past the post in favour of proportional representation.

But the UK Labour leader said it was not a priority for an incoming Labour government.

Earlier Sir Keir said he would return control over economic aid to Welsh ministers if he became PM.

Mr Drakeford spoke at Welsh Labour conference in Llandudno on Saturday.

He said in recent weeks he had been given ""words of kindness and sympathy, from people within our party, and also from people I've never met"".

""That has been a strength to me, personally - a heartfelt thanks to you all.""

Later he added: ""Even when our hearts are weighed down with the intolerable burden of grief, we know our duty, our moral obligation... that this party has to run towards the dangers that blight so many lives, and never ever run away from them.""

In his speech he gave his strongest support yet for major reforms to the Westminster electoral system.

He called for Sir Keir Starmer to bring an end to the first past the post voting system, which sees MPs elected based on which candidate wins the most votes in a constituency.

Keir Starmer and Mark Drakeford both spoke on the first day of Welsh Labour conference.

""The next Labour government must lead the task of democratic renewal,"" he said.

""I do not believe that we can go on simply accepting a system which time and time again produces Conservative majorities on a minority of the votes cast.""

Appearing to address critics of proportional representation within his own party, Mr Drakeford said: ""To those who continue to fear a change in the electoral system.

""I say simply look at what we have done here in Wales - 25 years of winning and working within a proportional electoral system.""

He accused the Conservatives of hollowing out democracy with a ""dreadful brand of selfish, self-enriching politics, where even a football commentator is expected to toe the Tory line or to find their job at risk"".

Responding to Mr Drakeford's calls for voting reform, Sir Keir said praised Mr Drakeford's ""powerful speech"".

""I don't think anybody could not be moved by Mark's speech."" He added: ""It's not a priority for an incoming Labour government.""

This was an emotional speech from Mark Drakeford whose enthusiasm for public life is clearly undimmed by his recent tragedy.

With all eyes at conference on an expected general election in 2024 he gave a rousing endorsement of UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.

But while Mr Drakeford is passionate about securing a UK Labour victory, it's also the case that the two men have very different views on some policy issues.

Sir Keir looked uncomfortable when Mr Drakeford argued for electoral reform at Westminster and the avowed socialist, Mark Drakeford, looked less than enthused by Sir Keir's emphasis on ""sound money"" .

Welsh Labour conference has always loved Mark Drakeford as first minister and his rapturous reception continued this time.

Delegates gave Sir Keir a notably warmer reception than he's had at previous Welsh party conferences, a sign perhaps of the party's increasing confidence ahead of the next election.

Police have seized up to £130m worth of cannabis plants and arrested almost 1,000 people in the UK's largest ever crackdown on organised crime.

More than 180,000 plants were discovered in raids across England and Wales in June.

Officers also seized 20 firearms, £636,000 in cash and 20kg of cocaine, with a potential street value of £1m.

The operation has been described as the ""most significant"" of its kind ever run across UK law enforcement.

Some 182,422 plants were seized, worth an estimated £115m-£130m

Operation Mille targeted what law enforcement believe is a cash cow for organised crime gangs (OCGs) who are also involved in other offences such as money laundering, Class A drug smuggling and violence.

Cannabis is a Class B drug, not Class A like heroin or cocaine, but large-scale cannabis cultivation is seen as a key source of illicit income for criminal gangs.

The aim of the month-long operation was to disrupt OCGs by taking out a key source"
39,"of their revenue, apprehending those involved and gathering intelligence on how the networks operate.

Steve Jupp, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for Serious and Organised Crime, said the operation had ""successfully disrupted a significant amount of criminal activity"".

""We know that organised networks involved in cannabis production are also directly linked to an array of other serious criminality such as Class A drug importation, modern slavery and wider violence and exploitation,"" he said.

""The intelligence gathered will also help inform future law enforcement across the country.""

Around 11,000 officers from all 43 police forces in England and Wales, as well as the National Crime Agency and Immigration Enforcement, co-ordinated over 1,000 warrants in June.

Of those arrested, more than 450 people have since been charged.

""Cannabis-related crime is often thought to be 'low level', however there are clear patterns around the exploitation and violence organised crime groups are using to protect their enterprises,"" Mr Jupp added.

""We also frequently find that cannabis production is just one aspect of their criminal operations and that they are complicit in wider offending which blights our communities.""

The NPCC is a body which brings leaders across police forces in the UK together to set policy direction.

This was among the items seized during the operation

Almost £650,000 in cash was seized

Hundreds of properties were left without power and trees blocked roads as Storm Noa swept across Devon and Cornwall.

Gusts of more than 60mph (96.5km/h) were recorded on the Isles of Scilly and the Met Office predicted wind speeds of up to 70mph (113km/h).

A tree fell on to a house in Raleigh Avenue, Cockington, Torquay.

Police said the road would be closed for the remainder of the day and Thursday until the tree was cleared.

It confirmed the fire service, highways and a tree management team were in attendance, and everyone in the house was accounted for.

A female driver suffered a face injury after hitting a tree which had blocked the A377 in Devon

Police also confirmed a woman was left injured when her car hit a tree that had fallen across the A377 near Copplestone, Devon.

She sustained a facial injury and was taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital.

The tree, which had blocked the road, was cleared with the help of a local farmer and emergency services.

Tree surgeons cut down and removed a fallen tree in Plymouth

A fallen tree was also reported outside of the Plymouth Guildhall with three cars damaged when it landed on them.

At 14:00 BST, the National Grid said 268 properties in Devon were without power.

More than 700 homes were also reportedly without power in the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall.

The National Grid confirmed power had been restored to most properties in St Austell and it was working to restore supplies to all homes later.

A tree fell outside the Plymouth Guildhall on to three cars

Speed restrictions were in place on the main rail line between Plymouth and Penzance and drivers on the M5, A38 and A30 were urged to take extra care.

Stagecoach South West reported its buses were diverted in Torquay due to a fallen tree in Hawkins Avenue and other services were delayed in Plymouth.

Ed Parkinson captured the crashing waves in Ilfracombe on Wednesday

The National Trust closed some of its sites on Dartmoor.

In a yellow warning, which was valid until 20:00, the Met Office predicted strong winds with severe coastal gales in the south and west.

It said the winds, low temperatures and heavy rain or showers were down to an Atlantic low-pressure system slowly moving eastwards across the UK.

Some campers evacuated campsites as winds tore down tents.

Steve Ackland, of Monkey Tree Holiday Park near Newquay, said: ""We had some fantastic weather last weekend and this is the flip side of that.

""It is what you expect in Cornwall in April and the fact that there are still so many people around is testament that it's a great place to be.""

Others like holidaymaker Katrina Kay were sticking it out.

""If you go camping you know what you're letting yourself in for, it's not been bad really,"" she said.

Last updated on .From the section The Hundred

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is ""starting to pursue"" private investment in The Hundred teams, says chief executive Richard Gould.

The Hundred, a 100-ball tournament launched in 2021, is currently funded by the ECB, with capital filtered down to the associated counties.

Gould said discussions had led to investment being sought at team level rather than in the tournament itself.

""We're looking at how that might manifest itself,"" Gould told BBC Sport.

""The Hundred is a good vehicle for private investment to come into the game.""

Private investment in cricket has grown with the owners of Indian Premier League teams - the world's biggest franchise league - investing in sides in South Africa, the United States and the United Arab Emirates.

The ECB has invested a further £100,000 in salaries for the women's game for 2024, but both the men's and women's players earn significantly less than in franchise tournaments in India, which has made it difficult to attract the world's best overseas players.

""Most of our counties are privately-owned members clubs. That has provided a great stable base for a number of decades but, sometimes, in order to be able to compete on a global scale we need to bring in private investment also,"" said Gould at a launch event before the new English domestic season starts on Friday.

The Hundred was created by the ECB to attract a more diverse audience and to fit into shorter broadcast slots.

A record 580,000 fans attended matches in 2023, with 41% of tickets sold to families and 30% to women.

However, the tournament has faced criticism from traditional cricket fans, who are unhappy with how some of the 18 counties are represented in the tournament.

The eight Hundred sides see counties combined, such as Yorkshire and Durham at Northern Superchargers, but others face lengthy journeys with fans of Somerset and Gloucestershire having Cardiff-based Welsh Fire as their nearest side.

Asked if there was a danger that investment at team level may result in money being harder to filter down and teams feeling more marginalised, Gould said he did not think that was the case.

""The way that our sport is organised and governed, everything under one umbrella, does allow us to make sure that any money that is available is invested in the area that is most appropriate and where we'll get the most return,"" said Gould.

The ECB are committed to the tournament until 2028 in a broadcast deal with Sky Sports, and Gould feels investment will take the tournament to new levels over the next five years.

""The excitement levels will significantly increase,"" he said.

""We'll be able to make sure we retain and attract all the best players in the world and have a game that either broadcasters, supporters or new fans want to be involved with.

""I'm very excited by what that could bring for the whole ecosystem of cricket, whether that is franchise led teams or county clubs.""

Sam Billings, who captained Oval Invincibles to the 2023 men's title, told BBC Sport: ""We want to be the second-best competition in the world, so"
40,"it is how we do that.

""It might be a partnership, and that is a really key word, because if it is and it is always invested back into the fabric of our game then those are the key components, because ultimately we still want the English game to be incredibly strong in 50-100 years.""

The 2024 edition of The Hundred begins on 23 July, with selected games on BBC TV.

The battle for Bakhmut has become the longest of the war that Russia launched last year

Russian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated the Wagner paramilitary group, after it claimed to have captured the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin - posing with some of his fighters - made the claim in a video posted to social media on Saturday.

Ukraine's deputy defence minister rejected the claim, but admitted the situation in the city was ""critical"".

One of the war's bloodiest battles, fighting has raged since August.

Wagner paramilitary forces have led the Russian attack on Bakhmut - which analysts say is of little strategic value to Moscow - and has seen thousands of troops killed.

Ukraine, for its part, has also decided to make a stand in a battle which has become the longest and bloodiest of the war so far.

But in comments carried by Russian state media, Mr Putin claimed Wagner troops, supported by Russian air force jets, had completed ""the operation to liberate"" Bakhmut on Saturday after months of intense fighting.

Mr Prigozhin, a close ally of the Russian president, leads the thousands-strong group, nominally a private military company.

He has claimed before that his forces have taken Bakhmut - or most of it - only for Ukrainians to swiftly deny the claims. Mr Prigozhin has also targeted top Russian military officials, criticising them publicly for not supplying his troops with enough ammunition.

In his latest video claiming control of Bakhmut, Mr Prigozhin said ""no-one can pedantically reproach us for the fact that at least some piece was not taken"".

Explosions can be heard in the background, suggesting fighting continues close to the city, if not inside it.

He also promised to hand the city over to regular Russian troops later in the month.

His claims were echoed by the Russian defence ministry on Saturday night, state media in Moscow reported.

Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed to control Bakhmut in a video flanked by Wagner fighters

But in a statement on the messaging platform Telegram moments afterwards, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said: ""Heavy fighting in Bakhmut. The situation is critical.

""As of now, our defenders control some industrial and infrastructure facilities in the area and the private sector.""

Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Bakhmut, while Ukraine's military has also paid a heavy price.

There is hardly a building left unscathed, and the city's entire population has vanished.

The latest Wagner claim came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went to Japan to attend a meeting of the leaders of the world's most industrialised countries, the G7.

His Western allies pledged more support, including taking a significant step towards providing F-16 fighter jets, and announced more sanctions on Russia.

Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February last year and control parts of its east.

Ukraine has been expected to launch an offensive to retake seized territories, but Mr Zelensky recently said that more time is needed to prepare.

He has called Bakhmut ""a fortress"" of Ukrainian morale.

Ukraine's hope is that the fight over Bakhmut has blunted Russia's ability to conduct its own offensive operations, and exhausted its army and supplies.

Police have charged 24 people after animal rights protesters tried to disrupt the Scottish Grand National.

A large group breached fences at Ayr racecourse and made towards the track at about 15:20 before a further smaller group tried to disrupt a later race.

Police Scotland said officers ""safely removed"" people on both occasions and no injuries were reported.

The force confirmed all 24 charges were over breach of the peace.

All were released and are due to appear at Ayr Sheriff Court on Monday.

Security was ramped up at the racecourse after protests delayed the start of the Grand National last week.

The Ayr protest followed the death of horse Oscar Elite in the 13:50 race on Saturday. Activists said they wanted to stop other horses from dying or coming to harm.

Although the activist group Animal Rising claimed to have delayed the 18-horse event, won by Kitty's Light, it started only three minutes late.

The group said it wanted to highlight the exploitation of animals for sport and food.

It said it will continue with more race disruptions as well as a series of farm occupations and animal ""rescues"".

Protester Sarah McCaffrey from the group said last week's protest at the Grand National started a ""crucial conversation about our relationship with animals and nature"".

On Saturday, she said: ""Today we continue that conversation. As a society, we love animals, but we have to find a way to care for them without harming them.""

Ms McCaffrey called for an end to horse racing and a transition to a plant-based food system.

Animal rights campaigners attempted to rush onto the course

Police Scotland Assistant Ch Con Tim Mairs said police officers and stewards had responded swiftly to intervene and ""prevent further escalation"".

He said: ""We worked closely with the event organisers and other partners ahead of the Scottish Grand National to ensure a proportionate plan was in place to keep people safe and facilitate peaceful protest.""

Ayr's managing director David Brown also praised the swift action of the police and security teams on course.

He said: ""The race went off to time, there was no notable delay and the professionalism of the team up here in Scotland was a credit to them, they dealt with it in a very efficient manner.""

Following the Grand National at Aintree last week, Merseyside Police said they arrested 118 people over disruption which saw nine people enter the course.

Up to 17,000 people were expected at Ayr racecourse for the Scottish version of the race.

The Scottish Grand National was inaugurated in Ayrshire in 1867 and has taken place at Ayr since 1966.

The home of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell was searched for two days at the start of March

Police had to wait two weeks before they were given permission to raid the home of Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, it has emerged.

The Crown Office was told on 20 March that Police Scotland wanted a search warrant.

It was not until 3 April - a week after the SNP leadership contest ended - that the application for a warrant was approved by a sheriff.

Officers searched the home of the former first minister two days later.

Details were released by Police Scotland in response to a Freedom of Information Request (FOI) by the Scottish Conservatives that was first reported by the Scottish Sun.

Sources close to the inquiry have denied that there was an undue delay.

But opposition parties said the revelation would ""raise eyebrows"" and questioned the role of Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC, who heads the Crown Office but is also a Scottish government minister.

Ms Bain did not answer when she was asked by Sky News whether the warrant had been deliberately delayed.

A spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: ""In all matters, Scotland's prosecutors act independently of political pressure or interference.""It is standard that any case regarding politicians is dealt with by prosecutors without the involvement of the Lord Advocate or Solicitor General.""

BBC Scotland understands that a draft search warrant was submitted by the police which the fiscal then discussed with officers before its contents were finalised.

The warrant, which is reported to have included a long list of items the police wanted to seize, was then signed by a sheriff on the same day it was finished.

Mr Murrell, who had quit as the SNP's chief executive on 18 March, was arrested when officers investigating the party's finances arrived at"
41,"the Glasgow home he shares with Ms Sturgeon early on the morning of 5 April.

Several boxes of evidence were removed from the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh

Police spent two days searching the house, with several boxes of evidence being removed. Mr Murrell was released without charge pending further investigations.

The SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh was also searched on 5 April and a luxury motorhome that sells for about £110,000 was seized from outside the home of Mr Murrell's mother in Dunfermline.

Colin Beattie, who was the party's treasurer at the time, was arrested on 18 April before also being released without charge while further inquiries were carried out. He subsequently quit as treasurer.

The contest to succeed Ms Sturgeon as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister had ended on 27 March when Humza Yousaf, who was the party hierarchy's preferred candidate, narrowly defeated Kate Forbes.

Newspaper reports earlier this year claimed that some people within Police Scotland were frustrated by the direction they were being given by the Crown Office on the SNP investigation.

Scottish Conservative MSP Russell Findlay told BBC Scotland: ""There has been this continual sense of something not feeling quite right and of some frustration being expressed not by journalists, not by politicians, but by police officers and this latest revelation perhaps only feeds into that sense.

""From what I understand the Crown Office is suggesting this was perfectly regular and routine, but the entire investigation is so sensitive and is subject to a huge amount of speculation and the more transparency there is around it the better.""

Mr Findlay said the case also raised ""fundamental questions"" about the role of the Lord Advocate, who heads the independent prosecution service while also sitting as a minister in Scottish government cabinet meetings.

He added: ""It doesn't feel appropriate. And that separation needs to happen.""

Jackie Baillie, the deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said the two-week delay was a ""very interesting revelation that will lead to raised eyebrows across Scotland"".

She added: ""While I accept that the Lord Advocate may not have had a direct influence on the timing, this story underlines why we need to have a serious discussion about separating the role of the Lord Advocate to ensure that no perception of conflict of interest can ever occur.""

Alba MP Kenny MacAskill, who served as justice secretary in the SNP government led by Alex Salmond, called for a judge-led inquiry into the Crown Office's role in the granting of the warrant to search Ms Sturgeon's house and the SNP HQ.

He said this would ""reassure the public that the decisions taken by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service have not been influenced by political considerations"".

Privately, prosecutors and police are deeply frustrated by the latest headlines and vehemently deny that the SNP's leadership contest played any part in the timing of the searches.

Some legal figures describe the two-week process to secure search warrants as unusually long.

A senior lawyer who has worked with the Crown Office in the past said: ""It all depends on why it took two weeks. If it was for operational reasons, there's nothing wrong with that.

""If it was for further inquiries, there's nothing wrong with that. If it was for political reasons, to delay things, there's a lot wrong with that.""

One source close to the inquiry said: ""The concept that there was a delay is misplaced. The decision was taken by a procurator fiscal with no political affiliation.""

Given the apparent complexity of the investigation and the fact that the stakes are so high, it would be astonishing if prosecutors were not taking their time and the greatest of care.

Inevitably, in something like this, it's a case of ""damned if they do, damned if they don't"".

Police launched their Operation Branchform investigation almost two years ago after receiving complaints about how a total of £666,953 donated to the SNP by activists was used.

The party pledged to spend the funds on a future independence referendum. Questions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under £97,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about £272,000.

Last year it emerged Mr Murrell gave a loan of more than £100,000 to the SNP to help it out with a ""cash flow"" issue after the last election.

The party had repaid about half of the money by October of that year. It still owes money to its former chief executive, but has not said how much.

Ms Sturgeon has previously said the police investigation played no part in her decision to announce on 15 February that she was standing down as SNP leader and first minister.

She also said the first she knew that the police wanted to search her home and arrest her husband was when detectives arrived on her doorstep.

She added: ""There are many questions that I would want to be able to answer and in the fullness of time I hope I will answer, but it would be wrong and inappropriate for me to go into any detail of what the police are currently investigating.""

Pouria Zeraati said he he is ""feeling better"" and recovering

An Iranian TV host stabbed in London has been discharged from hospital and says he is now staying in a safe place.

Iran International presenter Pouria Zeraati, 36, was repeatedly stabbed in an attack by a group outside his home in Wimbledon, south London, on Friday afternoon, his channel said.

The London-based station said it had faced ""heavy threats"" for 18 months.

Counter-terrorism officers are leading the investigation. The Iranian regime has denied any involvement.

Mr Zeraati thanked well-wishers for their ""sympathy, kindness and love in the past few days"".

""Fortunately, I am feeling better, recovering and I have been discharged from the hospital,"" he posted on X.

""My wife and I are residing at a safe place under the supervision of the Met Police.""

Mr Zeraati claimed the suspects in the attack had purposefully planned it.

A neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, told BBC News an officer had spoken to them and said there were three attackers who ran up the road and were picked up.

Iran International says it provides independent coverage of events in the country, but the regime in Tehran has declared it a terrorist organisation.

The channel's spokesman told BBC Today programme on Saturday the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) had been targeting journalists and their families.

Adam Baillie said: ""It was a shocking, shocking incident, whatever the outcome of an investigation reveals.

""But for him as a leading presenter, as with our other presenters and journalists, yes, it is a great shock.

""It's the first attack of its kind.""

Iran's charge d'affaires in the UK, Mehdi Hosseini Matin, said ""we deny any link"" to the incident.

Mr Zeraati posted a picture on Instagram on Saturday, showing him smiling from his hospital bed.

No arrests have been made, the Metropolitan Police said.

The force said it was not yet able to provide further information about any motive behind the attack, but Mr Zeraati's occupation coupled with recent threats towards UK-based Iranian journalists meant the investigation was being led by specialist counter-terrorism officers.

Cdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""I appreciate the concern this incident has caused, for local people as well as for those in similar lines of work and from Iranian communities.""

In January, the Foreign Office announced sanctions against members of the IRGC's Unit 840 following an ITV investigation into plans to assassinate two of Iran International's presenters in the UK.

At the time, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said ""the Iranian regime and the criminal gangs who operate on its behalf pose an unacceptable threat to the UK's security"".

Iran International resumed its operations in London last September after temporarily moving its broadcasting studios to Washington DC in February 2023 because of a ""significant escalation in state-backed threats from Iran"".

In a separate case in December last year, Magomed-Husejn Dovtaev, a Chechen-born Austrian national, was jailed for three-and-a-half years for spying on Iran International before a """
42,"planned attack"" on UK soil.

The Met Police said last year that since the start of 2020, 15 plots to either kidnap or kill UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime had been foiled.

Nearly 18 months ago, Iran International became one of the main providers of news during a wave of anti-government protests in Iran.

Eleanor Williams was found guilty of eight counts of perverting the course of justice

Three men tried to take their own lives after being falsely accused of rape and trafficking, a court has heard.

Eleanor Williams accused the men of attacking her and posted on Facebook in May 2020 that she was the victim of an Asian grooming gang.

The 22-year-old of Barrow-in-Furness was found guilty of perverting the course of justice in January.

During a sentencing hearing at Preston Crown Court, Mohammed Ramzan, said the lies had made his life ""hell on earth"".

Mr Ramzan said two weeks after he was arrested following Williams' claims, he attempted to take his own life.

He said: ""I still bear the scars to this day.""

Mr Ramzan said his property had been damaged and his businesses had been ""ruined"" after he and his family were targeted ""in the most horrendous way"".

""I have had countless death threats made over social media from people all over the world because of what they thought I was involved in,"" he said.

One of the men she falsely accused, Jordan Trengove, spent 73 days in custody

In a statement read to the court, Jordan Trengove said the word ""rapist"" had been spray painted across his house.

He said he spent 73 days in prison, sharing a cell with a convicted sex offender, after he was charged as a result of Williams' claims.

He said: ""Things had calmed down a bit until the Facebook post in 2020.

""This made things even worse for me. There were big protests and marches in Barrow.

""The lowest point was when I tried to end my life in August 2020.""

Oliver Gardner said his chance encounter with Williams in Preston led to him being sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Mr Gardner, who was accused of rape, said it was a ""real shock"" when he was contacted by Cumbria Police and told of her claims.

He said: ""It was just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

In his statement, he said he tried to end his life before being sectioned.

Cameron Bibby, who was the first man accused of rape by Williams in 2017, said he had to remove himself from most social media because of abuse and was scared to pick his son up from nursery because of the way people looked at him.

Williams' trial heard that police believed she inflicted the injuries on herself with a hammer

He said after Williams posted her account on Facebook, his neighbours displayed ""Justice for Ellie"" stickers in their windows, which ""intimidated"" him.

The court was shown videos of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson attending protests at Hollywood Retail Park in Barrow in May 2020.

In a statement, Supt Matthew Pearman said there was ""unprecedented outcry on social media within the town of Barrow"" after Williams posted about her injuries.

He said: ""Barrow had not seen such public displays of mass anger for over 30 years.""

Louise Blackwell KC, defending Williams, said she ""continues in her allegations against the various people in pretty much the same circumstances"".

Williams is due to be sentenced on Tuesday.

The former prime minister has not handed over any messages from before April 2021 - more than a year into the pandemic

Boris Johnson has said he is giving unredacted WhatsApp messages dating back to May 2021 directly to the Covid inquiry, bypassing the government which has refused to hand them over.

The Cabinet Office has launched a legal challenge to the inquiry's demand for texts from the former PM and officials.

It argues that many of the messages are irrelevant to the investigation.

However, the head of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, has said it's her job to decide what is and is not relevant.

In a letter to Baroness Hallett, Mr Johnson said that he understood why the government was taking legal action, but that he was ""perfectly content"" to release messages he had already sent to the Cabinet Office.

Mr Johnson added he would like to send messages pre-dating April 2021, but that he had been told he could no longer access his phone from that period ""safely"".

Security concerns were raised over the phone, after it emerged the number had been freely available on the internet for 15 years.

The messages received before this date would be likely to cover discussions about the coronavirus lockdowns implemented in 2020.

Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""test"" the advice received from the security services and had asked the Cabinet Office for assistance in turning his old phone on securely.

He added he no longer had access to his contemporaneous notebooks as he had handed these to the Cabinet Office.

""I have asked that the Cabinet Office pass these to you. If the government chooses not to do so, I will ask for these to be returned to my office so that I can provide them to you directly.""

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward said the risk of turning on Mr Johnson's old phone was ""minimal"", adding: ""It is perfectly possible to do that without exposing it to the potential threat.""

Earlier this week, the inquiry told the government to submit messages sent between Mr Johnson and 40 other ministers and officials during the pandemic by 16:00 BST on Thursday.

Mr Johnson said he was ""more than happy"" to give the unredacted material to the inquiry.

The Cabinet Office - which supports the prime minister in running the government - also holds communications between ministers and civil servants which do not involve Mr Johnson.

On Thursday, it missed the deadline and said it would ""with regret"" be launching a judicial review of the demand, but promised to ""continue to co-operate fully with the inquiry"".

Defending its decision not to hand over certain messages, the Cabinet Office argued that many of the communications were ""unambiguously irrelevant"", and that to submit them to the inquiry would compromise ministers' privacy and hamper future decision-making.

""It represents an unwarranted intrusion into other aspects of the work of government. It also represents an intrusion into their legitimate expectations of privacy and protection of their personal information,"" the Cabinet Office said, in a letter to the inquiry.

Speaking to the BBC One's Question Time on Thursday, science minister George Freeman said he thought the ""courts will probably take the view"" that Baroness Hallett was entitled to decide ""what evidence she deems relevant"".

But he added ""people's privacy is really important"" and that the question of how private correspondence should be handled was a ""point worth testing"".

""I would like to see a situation where the inquiry says: 'Listen, we will wholly respect the privacy of anything that's not related to Covid. We will redact it',"" he said.

Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described the government's legal action as a ""desperate attempt to withhold evidence"". The Liberal Democrats called it a ""kick in the teeth for bereaved families"".

Lord Barwell, who worked as chief of staff to former Prime Minister"
43,"Theresa May, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme he thought the government was making a ""bad mistake"".

He added: ""We're having the inquiry to give people confidence we're getting to the truth. And if the government is controlling what the inquiry can and can't see, then people are not going to get confidence in the outcome.""

Last updated on .From the section Cricket

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has spoken to leaders at the England and Wales Cricket Board after a report highlighted discrimination in cricket.

The Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) said racism, sexism, classism and elitism are ""widespread"" in the game.

""For people who love cricket that was hard to read,"" said Sunak.

""My first reaction was that it is really sad to see a sport I love being described like that.""

The ICEC was announced by the ECB in March 2021 in the wake of global movements such as Black Lives Matter and Me Too.

The damning report made 44 recommendations, including that the ECB makes an unreserved public apology for its failings. ECB chair Richard Thompson apologised on Tuesday.

""I've spoken to the team at the ECB and I think they have approached it in the right way,"" Sunak told BBC Test Match Special during the second Ashes Test at Lord's.

""They commissioned this report off their own back because they wanted to be proactive, so they deserve credit for that.

""From conversations I have had, they are absolutely committed to fixing the problems and for this to be a reset moment for cricket.

""We all want it to be open for everybody from all backgrounds and where everybody can feel respected and supported when playing it.

""I'm confident the leadership of the whole cricketing family share that ambition.""

Sunak said he will monitor the ECB's response to the report in the coming months.

""I want to see cricket to be inclusive and open to everybody,"" he said. ""I don't want to pre-empt how the ECB will respond.""

The ICEC criticised the lack of cricket in state schools, saying a talent pathway structurally aligned to private schools is partly to blame for ""elitism and class-based discrimination"".

Sunak praised the African Caribbean Engagement Programme (ACE), which helps young people from more diverse communities into the game, and was asked how cricket could be brought back into state schools when many pitches had been sold off by a series of governments.

He said: ""We as a government have put more money into school sports - £600m over the next couple of years. The government, typically, doesn't dictate what sports schools should play.

""After meeting the Lionesses [the England women's football team] we did support their campaign to make sure girls had access to the same sports as boys, as well as a minimum amount of sport we want all schools to do.""

Sunak spoke of his own childhood playing and watching cricket. He said he had not experienced racism in the game but had in wider society.

""There are instances in your childhood that stay with you,"" he said.

""But those instances I suffered as a child don't think would happen to my kids today because we have made incredible progress as a country.

""Of course there are pockets where we are not doing as well and we have to strive to be better.""

Sunak was also asked about the pressures of running the country and admitted it ""weighs very heavily"".

""When we have inflation at the levels it is at, the impacts on pay packets, budgets and what people can do for their kids,"" he added.

""It is my responsibility to fix it and make the situation better.""

The prime minister distanced himself from his predecessors, saying he wanted to ""act with integrity"" when asked how he would restore trust in politicians.

He said: ""There are lots of ways you can do that, acting with integrity, doing the right thing and doing the things you say.""

The publisher of the Mirror newspapers has made a court apology to the former Coronation Street actor Nikki Sanderson after admitting using private investigators to get stories about her.

A barrister for Mirror Group Newspapers said it ""unequivocally apologises"" to her, adding ""it shouldn't have happened and won't again"".

Ms Sanderson was giving evidence in her High Court case against the newspapers.

Despite the admissions, MGN denies targeting her more widely.

She is claiming damages for 37 articles published in the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People newspapers between 1999 and 2009.

Andrew Green KC, for the newspapers, said she had lived through ""much press intrusion"" and giving evidence would be ""unpleasant and stressful.""

In her witness statement, Ms Sanderson said she had been ""abused"" by MGN and ""attacked"" by people with more power than her.

Ms Sanderson joined Coronation Street in 1999, aged 15, playing the role of Candice Stowe and immediately became of interest to the media, the court heard.

Crowds would regularly gather outside the studios and photographers would appear to get pictures of her.

Ms Sanderson alleges the newspapers used information from her mobile phone voicemails which were hacked, and paid private investigators to get personal information about her.

Mr Green said a small number of records for calls from journalists to her phone numbers had been disclosed, but showed no evidence they were to hack her phone.

However, within invoices for payments to private investigators, Mr Green said four were for the firms ELI and Avalon, which have been implicated in unlawful information gathering

Making the apology, he said MGN admitted on four occasions in 2004 and 2005 journalists used the investigators to target Ms Sanderson.

Mr Green is continuing to cross-examine Ms Sanderson about the stories she has put at the centre of her case.

Prince Harry has said he is suing the publisher of the Daily Mirror to stop ""absolute intrusion and hate"" towards him and his wife.

The case is also due to hear from other claimants including Coronation Street actor Michael Turner, known professionally as Michael Le Vell, and Fiona Wightman, the ex-wife of comedian Paul Whitehouse.

They all allege unlawful methods were used to obtain information for stories and say senior executives must have known about it and failed to stop it, which MGN denies.

MGN, which has admitted widespread unlawful information gathering against other celebrities, has argued Ms Sanderson should have brought her legal action years ago, under rules that civil claims must be made within six years.

She called this ""gaslighting"" in her witness statement.

Describing herself as a ""young girl"" at the time, Ms Sanderson accused the publisher of ""hiring random men"" to follow her.

""They could have done anything to me,"" she said, adding that it was ""particularly distressing to learn that these illegal activities continued for a period of many years"".

Describing her experiences as ""abuse"", she said she did not use the word ""lightly"".

""The fact is these people were in positions of power and I was a child and a young female, and I was attacked by people who were more powerful than me - I did nothing to deserve this treatment.""

Ms Sanderson also said she was tricked into giving away the name of a hotel she was staying at in Zakynthos, Greece.

She said someone working for ""Disney or Universal"" contacted her mother saying they were interested in making her part of a film and needed to send a telegram.

""The next thing I know, the paps [paparazzi] and press had managed to find me, she said, adding she ""was little more than a child and they deceived me"".

Ms Sanderson also said she was subjected to ""mental and physical abuse"" as a result of public backlash from articles written in the Mirror.

As well as being shouted at in the street, she said on one occasion a group of girls set fire to her hair in the toilets of a club.

""Fortunately, I wasn't wearing any hair product, otherwise, my hair would have gone up in flames,"" she said.

Ms Sanderson said she came to think that ""random people"" or others at Coronation Street were selling stories about her.

She also said she was ""really hurt"" by one article which accused"
44,"her father of being a ""womaniser"".

""To have my personal life splashed over the papers for people to indulge in was heart-breaking.""

Last updated on .From the section Championship

Jeremy Sarmiento's goal in the final seconds gave Ipswich Town a dramatic victory over 10-man Southampton and put them top of the Championship.

Leif Davis' powerful strike was cancelled out a minute later by Che Adams' equaliser for the visitors.

Adam Armstrong slotted home to give the Saints the lead but Nathan Broadhead levelled in the 68th minute with an instinctive turn and finish.

James Bree was sent off after bringing Davis down with five minutes left, before Sarmiento netted at the death.

The result leaves Ipswich two points in front of Leicester City, having played one game more.

It was also a big blow to Southampton's slim hopes of automatic promotion.

Ipswich got off to the perfect start, with a lethal strike by Davis into the top left-hand corner opening the scoring.

Portman Road erupted as the ball flew into the net, venomously struck by the left-back, beating keeper Gavin Bazunu at his near post.

Russell Martin's side equalised immediately when Adams helped on Joe Aribo's pass into the back of the net.

Stuart Armstrong then made a determined run down the left-hand side before cutting infield and splitting open Ipswich's defence, finding Adam Armstrong, who fired low into the bottom corner of Vaclav Hladky's goal to give Southampton the lead.

Ipswich came close to equalising in the 65th minute when Al-Hamadi struck the post.

Broadhead then scored to level the game again with a first-time finish on the spin to beat Bazunu and trigger a deafening roar from the home crowd.

And with seconds remaining, Davis crossed to the penalty spot where Sarmiento mis-kicked before instinctively lashing out with his right foot, nudging the ball beyond Bazunu.

""I feel really proud of the effort everyone put in there. You have to enjoy moments like that. What a game to be a part of.

""There were so many good things in the performance and so much to improve. It was a real step up for us in quality to play a team like that.

""All of the subs had a great impact and it's the sign of our culture. All of our players and staff are joyous in the dressing room. We have to enjoy it.""

""Their (winning) goal came out of nothing. It shouldn't go in and Gavin (Bazunu) should do better. He'll know that.

""At 2-2 I thought we'd be the team that could win it but the red card changed everything. We should score more and can't concede the way we did.

""We came here with so many brilliant performances. It's so disappointing to lose. We were the best team tonight.

""The performance was great but moments have cost us. There's 24 points to play for and we have to win every game now.""

The EU has suspended all security cooperation with Niger after the country's army took power in a coup.

It comes shortly after the US declared its ""unflagging support"" for ousted president Mohamed Bazoum - seen as a key Western ally in the fight against Islamist militants.

On Friday the head of the presidential guards unit Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani declared himself Niger's new leader.

He said insecurity, economic woes and corruption led him to seize power.

But there are now concerns in the West about which countries the new leader will align with.

Niger's neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali, have both pivoted towards Russia since their own coups.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell joined the US and France in refusing to recognise the coup leaders and said security cooperation and budgetary aid was being suspended indefinitely.

Also on Saturday France, the former colonial power which had moved its regional military headquarters to the country after being forced to leave Mali, said it had suspended all development aid and budgetary support.

Meanwhile the African Union called on the Niger army to return to base within 15 days.

On Friday evening US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned those detaining Mr Bazoum - Niger's first elected leader to succeed another since independence in 1960 - that ""hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance"" was at risk.

However, the leader of Russia's Wagner mercenary group has reportedly described the coup as a triumph.

""What happened in Niger is nothing other than the struggle of the people of Niger with their colonisers,"" Yevgeny Prigozhin was quoted as saying on a Wagner-affiliated Telegram channel.

""With colonisers who are trying to foist their rules of life on them and their conditions and keep them in the state that Africa was in hundreds of years ago.""

He added: ""Today this is effectively gaining their independence.""

The BBC has not been able to verify the authenticity of his reported comments.

Wagner is believed to have thousands of fighters in countries including the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali, where it has lucrative business interests but also bolsters Russia's diplomatic and economic relations.

Wagner fighters have been accused of widespread human rights abuses in several African countries.

Gen Tchiani, 62, has been in charge of the presidential guard since 2011 and was promoted to the rank of general in 2018 by former President Issoufou.

He had also been linked to a 2015 coup attempt against the ex-president, but appeared in court to deny it.

On Friday Gen Tchiani said his junta took over because of problems in Niger including insecurity, economic woes and corruption.

He also addressed Niger's global allies, saying the junta would respect all of the country's international commitments, as well as human rights.

But the junta has had strong words for those who oppose them, accusing members of the ousted government who have taken refuge in foreign embassies of plotting against them.

They said any such attempt would lead to bloodshed, which has so far been avoided.

Life in the capital Niamey has largely returned to normal with markets and shops open, but civil servants have been told to go home.

Meanwhile Nigeriens have mixed feelings about the coup, with some saying insecurity in the country wasn't severe enough to justify a coup. But others have supported the junta.

Niger's coup is the latest in a wave of military takeovers that have hit the West African region in recent years, toppling governments in countries including Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.

It also comes as a big blow to the leadership of regional body Ecowas. Just two weeks ago, the bloc's chairman, President Bola Tinubu, warned that terrorism and the emerging pattern of coups in West Africa had reached alarming levels and demanded urgent, concerted actions.

This is the fifth coup in Niger since it gained independence from France in 1960, on top of other unsuccessful takeover attempts.

Why does the Bank of England keep raising rates?

James from Norwich notes that people are spending more because of high energy and food prices. The point of raising interest rates is to reduce the amount people spend - so why does the Bank of England keep raising rates? Lots of people are asking the same question – for entirely understandable reasons. Why would the Bank of England raise rates, increasing the financial pain on those already suffering, knowing that the impact on prices could be limited"
45,"? One answer is that the base rate is a blunt instrument, but pretty much the sharpest the Bank has. So, the committee has decided that a higher rate will dampen some non-essential spending, and bring down the rate of price rises (known as inflation). It may take some time. Clearly, the impact is that borrowing gets more expensive for millions of people. This may, or may not, be the end of the run of rate rises. It certainly isn’t the end of the debate over this policy.

Thames Water has seen its troubles deepen after its parent company defaulted on part of its huge debt pile.

Kemble Water has formally told lenders it failed to meet a deadline to pay interest on £400m of debt due on Tuesday.

The water giant has also asked lenders not to take any action as it explores its options.

Thames Water's 16 million customers will not be affected.

This notification confirms an announcement on 28 March that Kemble would be unable to repay its lenders as interest and principal payments - including a loan repayment of £190m due at the end of April - come up.

It has issued a formal notice to its bondholders, but asked them to take ""no creditor action"" in order to enable a ""stable platform"" for negotiations. Companies sell bonds to investors to raise the funds they need, paying the money back over time with a premium.

Being in default renders Kemble Water effectively insolvent but that will not affect the underlying utility business that supplies water and waste services to 1 in 4 people in the UK.

The company has been engulfed by a crisis which has seen shareholders refuse to pay a £500m lifeline injection that would have shored up its finances, as well as fierce criticism over Thames Water's handling of leaks and sewage treatment.

The future of Thames Water has been uncertain since fears emerged that it could collapse last June, with the latest developments raising questions around a potential restructure.

The company has been struggling with debts of £14.7bn.

But the new boss of Thames Water - and the regulator Ofwat - insist that the company has enough cash and overdraft facilities to see it through to May of next year.

While the dominos are falling at the parent company, these will fall short of triggering a collapse.

However, at some point Thames Water will need to raise new money. The current shareholders which include UK and Canadian pension funds as well as Chinese and Gulf State investors pulled the planned £500m cash injection when Ofwat rejected proposals to raise customer bills by 40% above inflation by 2030.

Kemble, which is funded entirely through dividends paid out by Thames Water, said it expects it will be able to provide a further update in ""the coming weeks"".

Regardless of what happens, water supplies to Thames Water's customers will continue as normal.

Humza Yousaf has won the race to succeed Nicola Sturgeon as leader of the SNP, and will now face a vote in the Scottish Parliament before being confirmed as the country's sixth first minister.

About 50,000 of the SNP's 72,000 members took part in the leadership vote, which saw Mr Yousaf defeat Kate Forbes and Ash Regan.

The leadership election was decided by the Single Transferable Vote system, with Mr Yousaf failing to win a majority in the first round of voting.

But he won 52.1% of the votes after second preference votes from Ms Regan, who was eliminated after finishing third in the first round, were redistributed.

Ms Forbes came second with 47.9% of the votes when second preferences were included, with Mr Yousaf receiving a total of 26,032 votes and Ms Forbes 23,890.

When Ms Sturgeon announced that she was standing down, she said she would continue as first minister until her successor was chosen.

It is expected that she will now formally inform the King of her intention to resign as first minister after more than eight years in the role.

On Tuesday, Mr Yousaf will be nominated by MSPs to replace Ms Sturgeon as first minister.

Any MSP from any party can also be nominated for the role. There were seven candidates in 2003, with Ms Sturgeon defeating then-Conservative leader Ruth Davidson in 2014, Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie in 2016 and both Mr Rennie and current Tory leader Douglas Ross in 2021.

It is expected that Mr Yousaf will be up against Mr Ross, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton this time around - although none of the opposition leaders has any prospect of winning.

After the nominees have all made a brief speech in parliament, MSPs will vote for their preferred candidate.

A candidate must receive more votes than all of their rivals combined in order to win.

If this does not happen, the contender with the least number of votes drops out and another round of voting is held.

This process continues until one candidate gets a majority of the votes cast.

The parliament's presiding officer, the equivalent of the Speaker in the House of Commons, will then recommend to the King that he appoints the winning candidate as first minister of Scotland. Unless something truly remarkable happens, that will be Mr Yousaf.

In the unlikely event that parliament cannot elect a first minister within 28 days, an election would be held.

The new first minister will be formally sworn in - probably on Wednesday - in a short ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.

He will then take the ""official declaration"", or oath of office, with the court's Lord President also asking them to take a vow as Keeper of the Scottish Seal.

Finally, he will also make an oath of allegiance to the King.

The first minister is likely to start the process of appointing government ministers after he has been sworn in.

Mr Yousaf - a republican - will also become a member of the King's Privy Council group of advisors, and is likely to be invited for a private audience with the monarch.

On Thursday, he will face opposition leaders for the first time at the weekly First Minister's Questions session.

The artwork has been unveiled in Orangefield Park in east Belfast

""For every dark night there's a brighter day.""

That's the message a group of young men in east Belfast is hoping inspires and gives comfort to people struggling with their mental health.

The young men have been meeting as a group every week since the death of one of their friends last year and have now unveiled a public art piece in a local park, in his memory.

Adam Woods was 21 when he died of an accidental drug overdose.

The artwork is part of a project based in Orangefield Park.

They hope it will also promote mental health awareness among young people who use the park.

The initiative has been supported by community groups including East Belfast Alternatives and Communities in Transition as well as Belfast City Council.

Adam Woods was 21 when he died last year

Cameron Watson, who is part of the group, believes the opportunity to meet up each week and have a laugh with mates helps young people who may be sad or depressed.

""It's brilliant because you never know, someone could be sitting in their house and they could be feeling very low, very down,"" he told BBC News NI.

""We do it every Thursday night. Having a chat for an hour, an hour and a half, it could make somebody's week.""

The group said the project has been in the works for about one year

Daniel Hodos also paid tribute to his friend at the art's unveiling.

""Adam's just another one of those unfortunate people to have lost their lives to the mental health crisis we have in Northern Ireland,"" he said.

Another of the group's participants, Luke Allison, hopes the project will help older generations have a better understanding about young people in the area and hear their voices.

""I think there's a bit of a divide with people not understanding us and thinking maybe we're just messers, we're young lads, we're negative, we're anti-social,"" he added.

""This just shows how much we aren't and"
46,"how we're going to be the future of this place.""

The group hopes the artwork will change perceptions about young people

Adam's mother, Lynda Woods, told BBC News NI she was overwhelmed by the effort that has gone into the project.

""It's just a testament of what they think of Adam and how much he touched their lives,"" she said.

""They're just so articulate and so passionate about mental health and helping the community.""

Adam's family and friends want the inscription on the art piece, ""for every dark night there's a brighter day"", to be an inspiration to other young people who may be struggling with their mental health.

A mayor of a small Mexican town has wed a caiman bride in an age-old ritual for prosperity. He could be seen kissing the reptile, whose snout had been tied shut.

The seven-year-old caiman, nicknamed 'little princess', is thought to represent a deity linked with mother earth. Her marriage to the local leader symbolises the joining of humans with the divine.

The tradition likely dates back centuries to Oaxaca state's Chontal and Huave indigenous communities. ""It is the union of two cultures. The union of the Huaves and the Chontales,"" Mayor Victor Hugo Sosa told reporters.

Dune star Timothée Chalamet and Hugh Grant of Notting Hill-fame pictured in the forthcoming Wonka

Hugh Grant has been pictured for the first time as an Oompa Loompa in the first official trailer for Wonka.

The movie tells the backstory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka, played by US star Timothée Chalamet.

It is set before the opening of his famous chocolate factory.

At the end of the trailer, Wonka meets Grant's green-haired and orange-faced character, who is trapped in a glass jar, noting: ""So you're the funny little man who's been following me?""

Chalamet revealed a still image of him as Wonka in 2021 but now the new trailer shows him in full flow

It is a departure for Grant, 62, who is best known for playing quintessentially English gentlemen in films like Notting Hill, Love Actually and Bridget Jones's Diary.

Portraying one of the workers at Wonka's factory, he is seen responding: ""I will have you know that I am a perfectly respectful size for an Oompa-Loompa.""

After Chalamet's Wonka appears to be unaware of the people from Loompaland, Grant's character opts to ""refresh your memory"" by playing him a tune and starting to dance.

He follows in the footsteps of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in portraying the character

Chalamet, 27, who rose to fame in 2017's Call Me By Your Name and went on to star in Dune, is shown in the clip complete with red coat and top hat at the start of Wonka's journey to becoming the famous confectioner. He's described as ""something of a magician, inventor and chocolate maker"".

We are informed that the protagonist, who has ""spent the past seven years traveling the world perfecting my craft"", will come up against a feared ""chocolate cartel"". He also teams up with a young girl, played by Calah Lane, on his way to inventing a chocolate that makes those who eat it fly.

The film, based on Roald Dahl's much-loved children's book Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, has been directed by Paddington film-maker Paul King.

It also stars Oscar winner Olivia Colman, Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins and Mr Bean star Rowan Atkinson, as well as former Great British Bake Off presenter Matt Lucas.

In taking on the central role, Chalamet follows in the footsteps of Gene Wilder, who starred in 1971's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory; and Johnny Depp, who appeared in Tim Burton's 2005 adaptation.

According to the on-screen captions, the forthcoming film will tell ""the wondrous story of how the world's greatest inventor, magician and chocolate-maker became the beloved Willy Wonka we know today"".

Speaking in May, Chalamet said: ""To work on something that will have an uncynical young audience, that was just a big joy.

""That's why I was drawn to it. In a time and climate of intense political rhetoric, when there's so much bad news all the time, this is hopefully going to be a piece of chocolate.""

Filming for Wonka began in the UK in September 2021, taking place at locations including Lyme Regis, Bath, St Albans, Oxford and the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, London - as well as at Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, near Watford.

Wonka is out in UK cinemas in December.

There have been calls for Orkney to become part of Norway

Orkney councillors have voted to investigate alternative methods of governance amid deep frustrations over funding and opportunities.

Council leader James Stockan said the islands had been ""held down"" and accused the Scottish and UK governments of discrimination.

His motion led to media speculation that Orkney could leave the UK or become a self-governing territory of Norway.

It was supported by 15 votes to six.

It means council officers have been asked to publish a report to Orkney's chief executive on options of governance.

This includes looking at the ""Nordic connections"" of the archipelago and crown dependencies such as Jersey and Guernsey.

A further change which would see the revival of a consultative group on constitutional reform for the islands was accepted without the need for a vote.

On Monday, the prime minister's spokesperson rejected the suggestion the islands could loosen its ties with the union.

Mr Stockan urged councillors to back his idea to find new ways to get greater financial security and economic opportunities for Orcadians.

Speaking to councillors on Tuesday, he said the motion was ""not about us joining Norway"".

He added: ""I say it's time for government to take us seriously and I say it's time for us to look at all the options we've got.

""There is a far bigger suite of options here - this could even be that we could get our money direct from the Treasury in London and look after our own future.

""We have been held down and we all know most of what I could say today in terms of discrimination against this community from governments. We all know how much less we get compared to other island groups.""

Council leader James Stockan says Orkney does not get fair funding within the UK

Orkney Islands Council previously voted in 2017 to look at whether the islands could have greater autonomy.

While councillors wanted to have a ""stronger voice"", they did not back full independence for Orkney.

Currently, most of the island's 21 councillors sit as independents - two are Greens.

Mr Stockan has said an ageing ferry fleet is among the issues being faced by islanders.

He previously told the BBC the situation was ""critical"" because the ferries, which are older than the Western Isles fleet, were beginning to fail.

His concerns were widely shared by other councillors, however some raised issues with self-governance, such as the cost of carrying out such investigations.

Cllr Steven Heddle also mentioned disadvantages including having to buy back the sea bed, and tuition fees for students wishing to study in Scotland.

He called Mr Stockan's"
47,"efforts ""politics of grievance"" and said that every council felt hard done by, citing roads in Edinburgh that were ""worse"" than Orkney's despite the council having far more funding.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesperson said: ""First and foremost there is no mechanism for the conferral of Crown Dependency or Overseas Territory status on any part of the UK.

""We have no plans to change the devolution settlement we are supporting Orkney with £50m to grow the economic prosperity of the Scottish islands, through the islands deal.

""But the government's position is that the UK is stronger united.""

Orkney was previously held under Norwegian and Danish control until it became part of Scotland in 1472.

The islands were used as security for the wedding dowry of Margaret of Denmark, the future wife of King James III of Scotland.

The Scottish government said in 2023-24 Orkney Islands Council would receive £89.7m to fund services, with an extra £4.6m from an increase in council tax by 10%.

A spokesperson added it was ""committed to supporting island communities"".

The Norwegian government declined to comment on the proposals.

Today's vote was never about Orkney becoming part of Norway, or any of the other headlines we've seen over recent days.

Rather it was a chance for councillors to express their extreme frustration with what they see as the unfair deal they get from the Scottish and UK governments, with council leader James Stockan saying the islands had been failed by both of them.

The successful passing of the motion is the first of many hurdles in Orkney gaining a degree of greater autonomy.

Council officials will now be tasked with investigating options. Mr Stockan said that ""nothing was off the table"" - including of course the much-publicised return to Norway or Denmark.

Reaction to the vote on the streets of Kirkwall has been fairly mixed.

Some don't want to see any tax-payer money devoted to what one councillor described as ""frankly bizarre fantasies"".

Others feel that the council does get a raw deal from both Holyrood and Westminster, and that anything that gets the two governments to sit up and pay attention is worth looking at.

The eyes of the global media have been on Orkney for the past few days.

It's now up to the islands council to capitalise on that attention.

Chinese authorities have warned of ""multiple natural disasters"" in the coming month, as heavy rains lash parts of the country.

A weather alert is in place for large areas of central and southwestern China and thousands of people have been evacuated.

A building collapsed into raging floodwaters in Chongqing. Meanwhile, in Henan province, rescuers were filmed freeing people trapped on top of a car in the middle of a torrent of water.

The former prime minister has not handed over any messages from before April 2021 - more than a year into the pandemic

Boris Johnson has said he is giving unredacted WhatsApp messages dating back to May 2021 directly to the Covid inquiry, bypassing the government which has refused to hand them over.

The Cabinet Office has launched a legal challenge to the inquiry's demand for texts from the former PM and officials.

It argues that many of the messages are irrelevant to the investigation.

However, the head of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, has said it's her job to decide what is and is not relevant.

In a letter to Baroness Hallett, Mr Johnson said that he understood why the government was taking legal action, but that he was ""perfectly content"" to release messages he had already sent to the Cabinet Office.

Mr Johnson added he would like to send messages pre-dating April 2021, but that he had been told he could no longer access his phone from that period ""safely"".

Security concerns were raised over the phone, after it emerged the number had been freely available on the internet for 15 years.

The messages received before this date would be likely to cover discussions about the coronavirus lockdowns implemented in 2020.

Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""test"" the advice received from the security services and had asked the Cabinet Office for assistance in turning his old phone on securely.

He added he no longer had access to his contemporaneous notebooks as he had handed these to the Cabinet Office.

""I have asked that the Cabinet Office pass these to you. If the government chooses not to do so, I will ask for these to be returned to my office so that I can provide them to you directly.""

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward said the risk of turning on Mr Johnson's old phone was ""minimal"", adding: ""It is perfectly possible to do that without exposing it to the potential threat.""

Earlier this week, the inquiry told the government to submit messages sent between Mr Johnson and 40 other ministers and officials during the pandemic by 16:00 BST on Thursday.

Mr Johnson said he was ""more than happy"" to give the unredacted material to the inquiry.

The Cabinet Office - which supports the prime minister in running the government - also holds communications between ministers and civil servants which do not involve Mr Johnson.

On Thursday, it missed the deadline and said it would ""with regret"" be launching a judicial review of the demand, but promised to ""continue to co-operate fully with the inquiry"".

Defending its decision not to hand over certain messages, the Cabinet Office argued that many of the communications were ""unambiguously irrelevant"", and that to submit them to the inquiry would compromise ministers' privacy and hamper future decision-making.

""It represents an unwarranted intrusion into other aspects of the work of government. It also represents an intrusion into their legitimate expectations of privacy and protection of their personal information,"" the Cabinet Office said, in a letter to the inquiry.

Speaking to the BBC One's Question Time on Thursday, science minister George Freeman said he thought the ""courts will probably take the view"" that Baroness Hallett was entitled to decide ""what evidence she deems relevant"".

But he added ""people's privacy is really important"" and that the question of how private correspondence should be handled was a ""point worth testing"".

""I would like to see a situation where the inquiry says: 'Listen, we will wholly respect the privacy of anything that's not related to Covid. We will redact it',"" he said.

Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described the government's legal action as a ""desperate attempt to withhold evidence"". The Liberal Democrats called it a ""kick in the teeth for bereaved families"".

Lord Barwell, who worked as chief of staff to former Prime Minister Theresa May, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme he thought the government was making a ""bad mistake"".

He added: ""We're having the inquiry to give people confidence we're getting to the truth. And if the government is controlling what the inquiry can and can't see, then people are not going to get confidence in the outcome.""

Toby Burwell went missing from his home in Newbold-on-Avon in February

The body of a missing 17-year-old boy has been recovered from a quarry in Warwickshire.

Police divers found the body in Newbold Quarry, Rugby, on Thursday afternoon.

He was formally identified as Toby Burwell, who had been missing from his home in Newbold-on-Avon since 20 February.

His death is not currently being treated as suspicious, Warwickshire Police said.

A force spokesperson added: ""Our thoughts remain with Toby's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.""

Police had been searching the water and land around Newbold Quarry since Toby's disappearance more than six weeks ago.

The 17-year-old was known to have previously gone swimming in the quarry at night.

Last week, Warwickshire Police said the evidence gathered strongly suggested Toby had got into difficulty while swimming in the quarry and never left the water.

""At present, the evidence we have gathered strongly supports the conclusion that Toby went to Newbold Quarry alone for a swim and that, tragically, he got into difficulty and remains in the water,"" Det Insp Gareth Unett said in a statement agreed with Toby's family at the time.

Specialist search officers, police divers"
48,", sonar and underwater drones had been used during the search operation, which was hampered by poor visibility and underwater hazards.

A file is now being prepared for the coroner, Warwickshire Police confirmed.

Joe Abbess, 17, was pulled from the water near Bournemouth Pier

The family of a 17-year-old boy who died after being pulled from the sea in Bournemouth say they are ""heartbroken and devastated"" at his death.

Joe Abbess and a 12-year-old girl, named locally as Sunnah Khan, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, died in the incident involving 10 swimmers on Wednesday.

Joe and Sunnah both suffered critical injuries and died in hospital.

Joe's parents said they had been ""privileged to have him in our lives"".

Dorset Police said it was continuing to investigate what had happened.

More than 200 people are understood to have attended Sunnah Khan's funeral on Saturday

In a statement, Joe's family said they and his friends would ""always love him"" and were ""incredibly proud of the fabulous young man he was"".

""He was kind and generous, loving and caring, hardworking and funny,"" they said.

""Joe was a talented trainee chef, with a bright future ahead of him... we are so sorry he will never fulfil his dreams and ambitions.""

The beach was cleared as emergency services attended the incident

They said Joe had been enjoying a day at the beach on Wednesday, adding: ""We would like to thank his friends and all of the emergency services who helped him, when this tragedy unfolded.""

Emergency services were called to the scene, which was packed with people on half-term holidays, just after 16:30 BST.

Eight other swimmers were rescued and treated on the beach.

RNLI and Dorset Police have had an ""increased presence"" along the seafront over the weekend following the incident.

RNLI and Dorset Police have had an ""increased presence"" along the seafront over the weekend

More than 200 people are understood to have attended Sunnah's funeral on Saturday, held by High Wycombe Mosques.

An earlier police statement confirmed there was no physical contact with a jet ski or boat and no-one jumped from the pier during the incident.

A man in his 40s, who was on the water at the time of the incident, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and has since been released while inquiries continue.

Two poultry workers in England have tested positive for bird flu, although there are no signs of human-to-human transmission, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) has said.

Both people were known to have recently worked on an infected poultry farm and have since tested negative.

Neither worker experienced symptoms of avian influenza, with both cases found during screening.

The risk to the general population remains very low, the UKHSA added.

The UKHSA is running a programme of testing workers who have come into contact with infected birds, but is also running asymptomatic testing.

The first person who tested positive is thought to have inhaled the virus.

The second person is thought to be a more complicated case and it is unclear whether they have suffered a genuine infection or whether they too inhaled the virus while at work.

The UKHSA says precautionary contact tracing has been undertaken for this second individual.

Chief Medical Advisor at the UKHSA Professor Susan Hopkins said that globally there is ""no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population.""

""It remains critical that people avoid touching sick or dead birds, and that they follow the DEFRA advice about reporting,"" she added.

Professor James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the finding should lead to ""greater attention"" on asymptomatic infection and sampling.

He said it was important to sequence the virus in the two workers and infected birds in order to see if there were any mutations of concern, adding that resampling the workers could indicate whether they had developed an immune response.

There are various different types of avian flu that have circulated in the past - the latest one infecting birds is H5.

Although none of these strains easily infect people, and they are not usually spread from person to person, small numbers of people have been infected around the world, leading to a small number of deaths.

There have been very few cases of bird flu transmission to people recorded in the UK. The virus is not that well suited to humans and does not spread as easily as it does between birds.

It usually requires very close contact with an infected bird, which is why experts say the risk to humans is currently considered very low.

These latest cases do not change that assessment. There is no suggestion that the virus has changed to become more infectious to us or spread from person to person.

A ""mandatory housing order"" for England and Wales was lifted on 18 April, meaning poultry and captive birds could be kept outside again.

The measures were introduced during the world's biggest ever bird flu outbreak.

Government guidance on the signs of bird flu and how to report it can be found here.

A great-grandfather from Merseyside has become the world's oldest living man.

John Tinniswood, who is 111 years and 223 days old, puts his longevity down to a fish and chips on a Friday and having hiked regularly when he was young.

Mr Tinniswood, who now lives in a care home in Southport, advises ""exercising the mind"" and ""moderation"".

The previous title-holder, Juan Vicente Pérez Mora of Venezuela, died aged 114 on Tuesday.

Mr Tinniswood, a Liverpool FC fan, was born in the city on 26 August 1912, and can recall standing on the terraces watching Billy Liddell and Everton's Dixie Dean.

He met his wife, Blodwen, during World War Two, and they married in 1942.

The couple were married for 44 years until Blodwen died in 1986.

Their daughter, Susan, was born in 1943.

He worked for Royal Mail, for Shell, and for BP until he retired in 1972.

He said his earliest memory was his first day at school at Lawrence Road and later The Holt Secondary School, now known as Childwall Comprehensive School.

He said he did not have a special diet but continues to enjoy his favourite meal, fish and chips, every Friday.

He also recommended to ""never over-tax your system"" for a healthy life, and to get along with people.

""We are all different people,"" he said.

""It is up to us to make that difference work, otherwise everything fails.""

Mr Tinniswood was presented with the Guinness World Records certificate on 4 April.

The world's oldest living woman, and oldest living person overall, is Spain's Maria Branyas Morera, who recently celebrated her 117th birthday.

The evidence for the oldest man living was examined by Guinness World Records' Senior Consultant for Gerontology, Robert Young, and the Gerontology Research Group.

This was history in the making - and you had to pinch yourself to think you were seeing it close-up, inside Westminster Abbey.

Over there was the battered but rather beautiful Coronation chair, with a King about to be crowned. It looked almost fragile waiting for its royal occupant.

You could feel the sense of expectation. It was really happening right here, on an altar full of candlelight, prayers and a glow of gold. The Abbey was like being inside a jewel box.

The first Coronation in"
49,"70 years proved to be a sumptuous, seamless and often surreal ceremony.

Before 2,300 guests, King Charles and Queen Camilla went through the ancient rituals, with a twist of modern signals about diversity.

But it was also like a spectacularly lavish wedding, with friends, families and famous faces crowded into every corner of the church, playing with their phones, checking to see who else was there.

And where else would international royalty, world leaders and 100 overseas heads of state get an opportunity to meet Ant and Dec?

The King is crowned in the 700-year-old Coronation chair

There were glamorous outfits and hats, splashes of military uniforms with epaulettes, plumes and swords, clerical robes and every shade and shape of national dress. The selfies on the way in were going to prove that they'd really been here.

There were traditional roles with baffling titles such as Bluemantle Pursuivant and Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and a number of men seemed to be entirely dressed in medieval flags.

Walking down the nave when he arrived, the King seemed to be pausing to take it all in.

What was he thinking, after all the decades that he'd been waiting for this day? Was he thinking about his mother, his own family, the responsibility?

When the Archbishop of Canterbury appeared to give the crown a couple of twists on his head, the King might have been thinking less charitable thoughts.

A guest in the Abbey takes a selfie with Ant and Dec

And the only person who could have stolen the King's show was possibly Penny Mordaunt, the lord president of the council, who hovered around the high altar looking like a deity who had escaped from an ancient Greek urn.

But the King must have been delighted with the music, not least because he'd chosen it himself, like all of this elaborate ceremony. It was like a big work of art and he was its creator.

At close quarters in the abbey, the orchestra and choir were remarkable, the music welling up like a tidal wave of sound. It was bouncing off the stained glass windows.

The piece by William Byrd had all the aching melancholy and stillness that you suspect King Charles would really have enjoyed. Handel's Zadok the Priest, full of drama and anticipation, was a real spine-tingler.

There was also the most eclectic collection of people in the congregation. There were hundreds of charity workers, US First Lady Jill Biden, President Macron and rows of celebrities, such as Joanna Lumley, Maggie Smith, Stephen Fry, and hello, it's Lionel Ritchie.

Many of the guests had been inside the abbey for hours before it started, which meant some of the best-dressed queues ever seen for the toilets. I'd never really thought about the mechanics of such a visit for a peer in floor-length robes and ermine.

It was a lavish and colourful spectacle in the Abbey

There had been stories about MPs complaining about a lack of tickets for the Coronation. Part of the problem might be there are now so many ex-PMs to accommodate. Even Liz Truss got a seat.

Boris Johnson arrived looking like his shirt collars were staging their own backbench rebellion.

The current PM, Rishi Sunak, had a speaking part, delivering the Bible lesson.

For those hoping to watch any body language between Prince Harry and his brother Prince William, there was nothing to see, as they may as well have been sitting a continent apart.

Harry arrived looking relaxed and chatty, despite this being a huge transatlantic flying visit, and was seated a couple of rows behind Prince William, the Prince of Wales.

Prince Harry was heading back to the US straight after the service

The older brother, who must have been thinking that one day he'll face his own Coronation, was more engaged in his own role in the ceremony.

There seemed to be glances exchanged too between the husband and wife at the centre of this event, who were maybe having the big public wedding they didn't have before.

King Charles now has his Queen Camilla beside him. It took them about half an hour to get to the Abbey in the morning, but their journey to this point has taken them decades.

It's impossible to go into Westminster Abbey without feeling the weight of history on every side. It seeps from every plaque and statue. Even the clothes had a story. The King was wearing a robe that had been his grandfather's and Catherine was wearing earrings that had been Diana's.

Many guests might have been remembering being here at the late Queen's funeral, which eight months ago went out through the same doors as today's newly-crowned couple.

The King and Queen left the Abbey in the Gold State Coach

Such grand occasions, snapshots for the history books, are where the past, present and future overlap.

With the music soaring and the guests on their feet, the King and Queen left the Abbey to step inside the crown-on-wheels that is the Gold State Coach, with umbrellas up against the rain.

The carriage pulled away, past a sea of waving camera phones, and another era had begun.

Donald Trump is accused of pressuring an employee to delete security footage at his Florida home, in new criminal charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified files.

The latest indictment adds one count of wilful retention of defence information and two of obstruction, making 40 charges in total in this case.

Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing and has called the prosecutor ""deranged"".

He is fighting multiple legal cases as he runs for president again.

In a Friday morning interview, he reiterated that he would not end his 2024 campaign even if he is criminally convicted.

Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty to earlier charges in the case, alongside his personal aide Walt Nauta, who also received two additional charges of obstruction on Thursday.

The property manager at the former US president's Mar-a-Lago estate, Carlos de Oliveira, has also now been indicted.

The revised charge-sheet outlines alleged efforts between Mr Nauta and Mr de Oliveira to obstruct the justice department's investigation.

According to the court document, they conspired in an effort to delete surveillance video after the Department of Justice issued a subpoena demanding footage of the area where it said confidential documents were held.

Prosecutors claim Mr de Oliveira twice told Mar-a-Lago's director of information technology that ""the boss"" wanted the server deleted, in a conversation he said must remain between them.

The IT worker responded that he did not believe he had the authority to do so, according to the indictment.

The employee, who is not named or charged in the indictment, has been identified as Yuscil Taveras.

The charge-sheet also describes a scene in which Mr de Oliveira ""walked through the bushes"" into a property adjacent to the Mar-a-Lago resort to meet Mr Nauta.

Later, the court filing adds, Mr Trump phoned Mr de Oliveira and promised him legal counsel at Mr Nauta's request.

A lawyer for Mr de Oliveira has declined to comment on the allegations.

The updated indictment also says that Mr Trump knowingly discussed a top-secret document with biographers visiting Mar-a-Lago to interview him.

The paper Mr Trump allegedly revealed to the biographers contained possible plans to attack ""Country A"", which refers to Iran.

""Look what I found... Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers, this thing just came up. Look,"" Mr Trump allegedly said to one of his guests.

The indictment included images of files allegedly stored in a shower

The documents case is led by special prosecutor Jack Smith, who is also overseeing a separate investigation into alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump's attorneys John Lauro and Todd Blanche met officials at Mr Smith's office in Washington DC.

The former president said on Thursday his lawyers had received no indication of timing of when charges may be filed in the case.

In an emailed statement, his presidential campaign dismissed the fresh charges as a ""way to salvage their illegal witch hunt"".

Cong"
50,"ressional Republicans also defended Mr Trump against what many in the party have called a ""weaponised Department of Justice"".

Missouri Senator Josh Hawley suggested the charges had been timed to distract from the collapse of a plea deal for President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, over tax and gun offences.

Mr Biden is also facing a special counsel investigation into his handling of classified documents, some of which were discovered in a garage at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.

On Friday, a former Trump lawyer said ""the evidence is so overwhelming"" against his former client.

""I think this original indictment was engineered to last a thousand years and now this superseding indictment will last an antiquity,"" Ty Cobb, who represented Mr Trump early in his presidency, told CNN.

The latest charge against Mr Trump adds to a growing list of legal problems for the property and reality TV mogul.

He currently awaits trial on 34 felony counts in a hush-money case in New York, and also faces a defamation case from writer E Jean Carroll.

Georgia prosecutors are still weighing whether or not to press state charges over an alleged effort to overturn the election results there.

Former Trump aide Stephen Moore told the BBC the charges against the former president would only serve to solidify his nomination in the Republican presidential race.

""The more they indict him, the more his popularity goes up with Republicans"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Denise Gossett, her son Roman, her daughter Sabrina and Sabrina's daughter Morgana were all killed in the fire

A jury has been sworn in for the trial of a man accused of causing a fire in which a family of four died in County Fermanagh.

The fire happened at their rented home in Molly Road near Derrylin on 27 February 2018.

Daniel Sebastian Allen, 32, denies each of their murders and one count of arson endangering life.

The court was told that Mr Allen, whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, accepted the manslaughter of Denise and Sabrina Gossett.

He claim their deaths were due to ""a suicide pact"".

Daniel Allen, pictured at a previous court appearance, denies four counts of murder

The judge outlined the circumstances of the case to the jury.

He said the emergency services were called to a fire in a cottage near Derrylin.

When they arrived Mr Allen was standing outside and four bodies were discovered inside.

The prosecution case is that Mr Allen is responsible for all four murders and the arson.

He denies the four murders and claims he did not play any part in the deaths of Roman and Morgana.

The judge said that if there was a suicide pact with the eldest two then it would be open to the jury to return verdicts of manslaughter rather than murder in those two cases.

The jury of seven men and five women were told to return to court on Tuesday morning.

The trial at Dungannon Crown Court, sitting in Craigavon, is expected to last three to four weeks.

Victory Day commemorations in Berlin saw many turn out in the German capital with differing views

Russian communities across Europe have been polarised by the Ukraine war - and that threatened to spill over in Berlin this month when they marked the defeat of Nazi Germany.

Given how much Vladimir Putin uses the Soviet victory over fascism in 1945 to justify Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there was no avoiding the war here in the German capital.

Many German-based Russians clearly believe the president's reasons for the war, with some views in Berlin virtually indistinguishable from the narratives promoted by Russian state TV - but others are just as vocal in opposing it.

The commemorations in Berlin started on 8 May, as Germany marked the 78th anniversary of its liberation from fascism, and groups of Russians visited the Soviet war memorial in Treptower Park.

One, Alexander, who is originally from Russia but has lived in Germany for more than 20 years, said he believed Russian forces were ""defending Donbas, Crimea, Kherson, and Odesa against fascists"" - listing places in south-eastern Ukraine.

Alexander shows personal items decorated with portraits of Putin, he says he believes Russia is fighting fascism in Ukraine

""They belong to Russia! Russia is taking back what belongs to it,"" added Anna, another Russian living in Germany.

Alexander then showed me a cigarette holder and a tobacco box he had decorated by taping portraits of President Putin to them.

But the events that matter most to Russian speakers were held the following day, 9 May - marked in Russia as Victory Day.

They kicked off with the Russian ambassador laying flowers to the imposing statue of a Soviet soldier in Treptower Park. Again, the event mostly attracted supporters of the Kremlin's policies and rhetoric.

One of them, a young Russian called Yevgenia, told me that ""the collective West, particularly America"" were fanning the flames of neo-Nazism in Ukraine.

Yevgenia was sporting the St George's Ribbon - a Kremlin-backed symbol often used by Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. Like many at the rally, she and her friend held aloft a Soviet flag, as Russian flags were banned.

But not everyone supported such views.

The monument to the grieving mother at the other end of Treptower Park was the meeting point for those who wanted to honour the victims of fascism without supporting Mr Putin's claims that he is fighting ""fascists"" in Ukraine.

And many of the people who gathered there were Russians. One of them, Kirill, told me he fled Russia last October to avoid being drafted into the army and being sent to fight in Ukraine.

""I do not want to become a murderer for Putin. I do not believe the lies I'm told by TV,"" he said.

""I was very afraid, but I attended anti-war rallies. I did all I could do,"" Kirill told me, standing alongside a poster about political prisoners in Russia.

Kirill, with a poster of political prisoners in Russia, says he left the country to avoid being drafted into the Russian army

Kirill fled Russia after being arrested, fined and beaten for attending anti-war rallies in St Petersburg.

Another young Russian in this corner of Treptower Park, an activist called Alexandra, thought President Putin had turned Victory Day into a propaganda tool. ""It is an absolute sacrilege for us,"" she told me.

Her friend Ekaterina chimed in: ""It is important for me to show that not everyone from Russia supports what is happening in Ukraine or what this day has turned into.

""The way it is marked now is a one big reason why this war started on 24 February last year.""

At another important event held by Russians in Berlin on Victory Day, dozens gathered at the Brandenburg Gate for what is known as the march of the Immortal Regiment.

Even though such marches are encouraged by the Kremlin, the one held in Berlin seemed less overly political than the events in Treptower Park, with dozens of Russians solemnly carrying photographs of their ancestors who fought in World War Two.

A group of anti-war Russians demonstrated against Victory Day being turned into a propaganda tool - but their event was outnumbered by the rally sporting Kremlin-encouraged symbols such as St George's ribbons or Soviet flags.

Kristina attends a demonstration with a sign criticising the West's supply of weapons to Ukraine

But what do Germans think of all this?

I was able to find the whole spectrum of opinions among them. Many came to Treptower Park on 8-9 May to offer thanks for the Soviet army liberating Germany from fascism, and were less concerned with the present.

""What Putin is doing in Ukraine now doesn't change the fact that [Russia did liberate Germany],"" one of them, Wolfgang, told me.

Another German demonstrator, Kristina, was against weapons deliveries to what she described as the ""fascist regime"" in Ukraine.

But a young man,"
51,"Janek, said it was ""shameful"" that President Putin was using the defeat of Nazism as a foreign policy tool.

""They say they want to free Ukrainians from the Nazis there - but it's just not true, it's propaganda,"" he said.

A girl has died after a Land Rover crashed into a primary school in Wimbledon, south-west London, on Thursday morning.

The driver, a woman in her 40s, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Police say they are not treating the crash as terror-related.

Reality TV contestant Stephen Bear has been jailed for 21 months for sharing a private video of him having sex with his ex-partner.

Bear, 33, shared CCTV footage of himself and Love Island star Georgia Harrison, which was uploaded to OnlyFans.

He had caused her ""extensive humiliation and embarrassment"", the judge said.

Ms Harrison said she had been through ""absolute hell"" since 2020.

""Today's sentence is a vindication of what I've been put through and sends a clear message that the police and courts take this matter very seriously,"" she told reporters outside Chelmsford Crown Court.

""I want to let all other victims of this crime know that I stand in solidarity with them and I have absolutely no regrets on waiving my anonymity.

""I hope this puts anyone off committing this sort of crime and I hope for anyone who has been a victim of it, it gives them some sort of justice.""

Bear was found guilty of voyeurism and disclosing private, sexual photographs and films in December.

Ahead of his sentencing, he posed for a selfie outside the court building and began to sing Lady In Red to a reporter wearing a red coat.

As he was led down to the cells, he raised a hand to wave from the secure dock, and said: ""Have a good evening. Enjoy the weekend everyone.""

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he had shown a ""complete lack of remorse"".

Bear was given a restraining order to not contact Ms Harrison, who has appeared on The Only Way Is Essex and Olivia Meets Her Match, for five years.

He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register and will be subject to notification requirements for 10 years.

Jacqueline Carey KC, prosecuting, told an earlier trial that Ms Harrison and Bear had consensual sex at his home in Loughton, Essex, but Ms Harrison did not know they were being recorded.

Ms Harrison said that when Bear showed her the footage she told him ""never to send"" it to anyone and ""made it plain how upset she would be if he did"", the prosecutor said.

Stephen Bear, pictured arriving at an earlier hearing, posed for selfies outside of court ahead of sentencing

The victim said she saw Bear send the footage to someone on WhatsApp later that day, and later that year she was made aware it was circulating online.

Ms Carey said Bear uploaded the footage ""either himself or had it uploaded to OnlyFans and profited financially"".

Judge Christopher Morgan, sentencing, said the disgraced reality TV personality ""wished to exploit the economic value of the recording"", as Ms Harrison ""would have been known and recognised by many people"".

Following the hearing, Hannah von Dadelszen, deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS East of England, said: ""I want to commend Georgia Harrison for the bravery and determination she has shown throughout this case.

""By contrast, Stephen Bear showed a complete lack of remorse by never accepting responsibility for his abusive behaviour, even going so far as to place the blame on Ms Harrison.

""Although she lives a public life, Georgia Harrison has the right to privacy.

""But that was taken away by Bear to make money in the most egregious way.""

Bear was arrested at Heathrow Airport in January 2021

Her thoughts were echoed by Det Con Brian Sitch of Essex Police, who praised Ms Harrison for her ""immense bravery and patience"".

""This young woman stood in a court room, in front of strangers and went over the most personal details of her private life,"" he added.

""She had to sit her family down and explain to them that this video had been leaked.

""This was all because Stephen Bear thought he could secretly film his former partner and thought he could get away with appalling crimes.""

Oil and gas giant Shell has reported a stronger than expected profit of $9.6bn (£7.6bn) for the first three months of the year.

The figure was higher than the same period last year despite a slide in energy prices.

Fossil fuel firms have been reaping record profits due to a surge in oil and gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.

However, they have since fallen from the post-invasion peaks.

Shell chief executive Wael Sawan said the company had delivered ""strong results and robust operational performance, against a backdrop of ongoing volatility"".

The company also said it would be returning $4bn to shareholders, by buying back some its shares over the next three months.

Despite the fall in oil prices in recent months, Shell said its profits had been boosted by strong trading in its chemicals and refined products business.

Earlier this week, BP had also reported strong earnings for the first three months of the year - although they were lower than in the same period in 2022.

In February, Shell reported profits of $39.9bn for 2022, double the previous year's total and the highest in its 115-year history.

While the jump in oil and gas prices following the start of the war in Ukraine led to big profits for energy companies, it also fuelled a rise in energy bills for households and businesses.

Last year, the UK government introduced a windfall tax on profits made from extracting UK oil and gas - called the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) - to help fund its scheme to lower gas and electricity bills.

Under the government's Energy Price Guarantee, energy bills for a typical household have been limited to £2,500 a year, although this level of support is due to stop at the end of June.

However, the fall in oil and gas prices on the international markets has raised hopes that bills will fall below this level in July, making the price guarantee redundant.

Oil prices have dropped to around $80 a barrel from highs of nearly $128 following the invasion of Ukraine.

Eight BBC local radio presenters are to share a broadcasting award for interviews with former Prime Minister Liz Truss last year.

The hosts grilled the then prime minister days after her mini-budget sparked turmoil in the economy.

The Broadcasting Press Guild said their interviews were ""were game-changing for Liz Truss and her doomed government"" and will award them its jury prize.

It comes as BBC local radio stations in England face cuts to their programmes.

Ms Truss faced tough questioning during the round of local radio interviews in September.

The eight interviewers are:

Grant Tucker"
52,", who chairs the Broadcasting Press Guild, said: ""As an organisation of journalists, the BPG is always among the first to see the value of great interviewing - and these BBC radio interviews were game-changing for Liz Truss and her doomed government.

""There is no doubt that the PM's feet were held to the fire in these eight radio sessions in a way that stood out among so much drama that was happening in British politics last summer.""

The BBC's controller local audio commissioning, Chris Burns, said: ""It really was an iconic moment in local radio and also for how we work digitally, as the interviews were then packaged up into the most popular Newscast episode of all time for BBC Sounds.

""Our presenters - as they always do - were speaking for the communities they serve, as well as the whole country when they asked those questions. That is the beauty of local audio.

""We are immensely proud of everything local BBC radio does and it's fantastic to see the work acknowledged with this award.""

The BPG ceremony, in London later, comes a week after staff on the BBC's regional TV bulletins and local radio and online output in England staged a 24-hour strike over the corporation's plan for its 39 local radio stations in England to broadcast more merged shows in the afternoons, evenings and at weekends.

The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has said it will ""undermine already hollowed out local-radio content across England"".

But the BBC has said its proposal will ""modernise local services across England - including more news journalists and a stronger local online service - which will see no overall reduction in staffing levels or local funding"".

The Vietnamese migrants travelled by ferry from Belgium to Purfleet, before the trailer was opened in Grays

A Romanian man has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants who were found suffocated in a sealed lorry trailer.

The victims, including 10 teenagers, were discovered in Essex in 2019.

Marius Mihai Draghici also admitted one count of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration at a hearing at the Old Bailey.

The 50-year-old was remanded in custody and Judge Richard Marks KC said he would be sentenced at a later date.

Draghici was detained in Romania last August following the execution of a European Arrest Warrant and was extradited to the UK.

The 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK

The bodies of the 39 people were found in Grays on 23 October 2019, after the lorry had travelled by boat from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet on the Thames estuary.

An inquest heard their medical cause of death was asphyxia and hyperthermia, as temperatures rose in the back of the sealed lorry container and oxygen levels dropped.

Each of the lorry victims, and their families, had paid significant sums of money to an organised criminal group that promised a better life and safe passage to the UK.

Det Ch Insp Louise Metcalfe said it was ""the most complex investigation ever undertaken by Essex Police"".

""We have always maintained that the actions we believed Draghici was responsible for could never go unpunished. We now know they will not,"" she added.

Police said Draghici's role was to be involved in the onward transportation of the migrants once they arrived in the UK.

Four men have been previously jailed over the deaths.

A sense of limbo. The prime minister deciding not to decide, yet, about the future of his deputy, Dominic Raab.

The judgement call is binary: keep him, or sack him.

The prime minister has seen the report from Adam Tolley KC. The deputy prime minister has too.

Rishi Sunak and Dominic Raab did not speak on Thursday.

Mr Raab has said for some time that he would resign if it was concluded he was a bully. But Mr Raab has not resigned.

It seems reasonable, therefore, to conclude the deputy prime minister does not think the evidence in the report amounts to bullying.

So the decision over his future is down to the prime minister.

The government had created an expectation Mr Sunak's verdict would be quick.

Those participants in this process had been told to expect its outcome on Thursday, but it didn't come.

Equally, we should add a bit of context: when Boris Johnson was prime minister, he waited several months to publish and offer his verdict on an inquiry into his Home Secretary, Priti Patel.

That inquiry, by his standards adviser Sir Alex Allan, concluded Ms Patel had broken the Ministerial Code, but Mr Johnson ignored it.

Talking to us on BBC Newscast, Sir Alex said of Rishi Sunak's quandary now: ""You can understand, if it's a huge report, the prime minister may want time to consider it. But as far as I can see it probably cannot be completely clear cut. Otherwise he would have come out with a decision one way or the other.""

But the waiting is having consequences.

Mr Raab knows the names of those in his department, the Ministry of Justice, who were complainants.

Those complainants fear he might keep his job.

""The prime minister's prevarication makes it feel more likely that the whole thing, the last five months of agony for Raab's subordinates, will end in a whitewash,"" somebody who advised Mr Raab in a senior role in one department told the BBC.

Are resignations possible from the civil service if Mr Raab keeps his job?

""I think so,"" Dave Penman of the civil servants' union the FDA said.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Very few people have seen Adam Tolley's report, and next to nothing has leaked from it.

We should reserve judgement until we see it.

Mr Sunak faces turbulence whatever he decides to do.

Sack the man who loyally campaigned for him to become prime minister and create a big vacancy at the top of government and a big question about whether he should have appointed him in the first place.

Keep him and face potential mutiny inside the Ministry of Justice and the prospect of alleged victims of Mr Raab's behaviour resigning, demanding a move and maybe talking publicly.

""Either outcome gives him a management problem,"" one senior Conservative MP reflected to me.

A friend of Mr Raab told me the deputy prime minister has long been ""moderately optimistic"" the report might be less than clear cut.

Mr Raab is facing a moment of jeopardy over his job.

Rishi Sunak is facing a moment of jeopardy over his judgement.

Police in Australia have revealed details of an undercover operation that stopped nearly $700m worth of cocaine (around 1bn AUD, £570m) linked to a Mexican drug cartel from reaching the country.

It is reported to be the biggest drug bust in Australia's history.

Operation Beech began in November when narcotics officers seized 2.4 tonnes of the drug off the coast of South America.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has paid a surprise visit to Mariupol, a Ukrainian port captured by Russia after its forces pounded much of it to ruins.

An official video shows Mr Putin driving a car through streets at night and speaking to people. The Kremlin says it happened late on Saturday.

It is believed to be his first trip to a newly-occupied Ukrainian territory.

Mariupol's exiled mayor told BBC News that Mr Putin was a ""criminal"" who had ""returned to the scene of the crime"".

""He has come in person to see what he has done,"" Vadym Boychenko said. ""He's come to see what he will be punished for.""

Other exiled Ukrainian city officials said Mr Putin had visited at night so he would not see the destroyed city in daylight.

Tass news agency says he travelled to Mariupol by helicopter. In the video he is in the car with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin, who explains how the city is being rebuilt.

The Kremlin has said the decision to drive round the city was made spontaneously by the Russian leader.

Putin also visits the city's Philharmonic Hall, which had been due to be used for trials of captured Ukrainian forces before they were released in a prisoner swap instead.

The Russian leader is also reported to have met top military commanders in Rostov-on-Don, a Russian city just east of Mariupol.

Mariupol has been under Russian occupation for more than 10 months after being devastated in one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the conflict. Ukraine says more than 20,000 people were killed there.

UN analysis estimates that 90% of the buildings were damaged and around 350,000 people were forced to leave, out of a pre-war population of about 500,000.

Mr Putin was filmed looking at maps near residential buildings

A group of locals have told the BBC that Russia is conducting an expensive campaign to rebuild the city and win over the hearts and minds of its people. The purpose is to assimilate Mariupol and make it Russia's own. Russian authorities say 300,000 people are now living there.

The fighting saw Russia strike a Mariupol theatre where hundreds of civilians were sheltering. The building collapsed, and at least 300 are believed to have died there.

Ukraine and human rights groups say the attack amounted to a war crime.

It is among incidents for which Mr Putin and his regime could be held legally responsible, the United Nations has said.

The International Criminal Court said on Friday it had issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Putin over involving the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. It means he could now be arrested if he sets foot in any of the court's 123 member states.

On Saturday Mr Putin made an unannounced visit to Crimea, to mark the ninth anniversary of Russia's annexation of the territory from Ukraine.

He visited a new Russian arts school, a children's summer camp and future cultural projects, such as the New Russia museum and museum of Christianity, Russian state media reported.

The Kyiv authorities have vowed to liberate all Russian-occupied territories, including Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.

Wrexham beat 1"
54,"0-man Manchester United 3-1 but the newly promoted League Two club's victory was overshadowed by an injury to talisman Paul Mullin.

Mullin, 28, suffered a punctured lung in a collision with goalkeeper Nathan Bishop, part of a United side mostly comprised of Under-21 players.

Boss Phil Parkinson subsequently warned Bishop to ""steer clear"" of Wrexham following the ""reckless"" challenge.

Spanish 19-year-old Marc Jurado scored in first-half injury time for United, who had Dan Gore, 18, sent-off shortly after the restart.

Ryan Reynolds was unable to attend but Wrexham co-owner Rob McElhenney was present to see his side earned a memorable win in front of a sold-out 34,248 crowd at Snapdragon Stadium in California.

United boss Erik ten Hag, whose senior players have travelled on to Texas before tomorrow's match against Real Madrid, watched his youthful side's performance from the bench.

The Premier League club's starting line-up also featured the experienced Jonny Evans, who has returned on a short-term deal after leaving Leicester City at the end of last season.

Bishop apologises but is warned to 'steer clear' of Wrexham

Mullin scored 46 goals in all competitions as Wrexham ended a 15-year absence from the football league last season.

But the striker will now miss the start of the campaign following his collision with 23-year-old Bishop, who received a yellow card for the foul.

Mullin required lengthy treatment before walking off the field with an oxygen mask around his neck early in the first half.

Manager Parkinson expressed his anger after the match: ""It is a real blow for us, you can't hide away from that. I thought it was a clumsy challenge from the goalkeeper and it should have been a straight red.""

He added: ""It was a dangerous challenge and Mulls is our talisman. I'm fuming with it, I have to be honest about that. It was a clumsy, reckless challenge in a pre-season game.

""I haven't seen the goalie and he's probably best steering clear of us for the time being because we're not very happy.""

Bishop sent an apology to Mullin on Twitter: ""Just wanted to share my sincerest apologies to Paul Mullin. A complete misjudgement and a genuine accident with no malicious intent at all!

""Wishing you the speediest recovery and hope to see you back scoring goals as soon as possible!""

Lee opened the scoring after 29 minutes and Hayden headed in a second seven minutes later - but Jurado's side-footed finish halved the deficit.

United's Gore was dismissed after receiving a straight red for a tackle on Andy Cannon early in the second half, before Dalby headed in Wrexham's third from close range.

Stormont has been without a functioning executive or assembly since last February

Stormont parties have said they will need at least £1bn of extra funding to manage budget pressures in a future executive.

They were speaking after meeting the head of the civil service to discuss the ongoing governance gap.

There is no functioning executive or assembly because of the DUP's protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements.

The party needs to ""get off the fence"" and return to government immediately, Sinn Féin's vice-president has said.

Michelle O'Neill was among party leaders who met Jayne Brady to discuss Northern Ireland's budget crisis and lack of government.

Her party is now the largest party in local government and the assembly having made gains in last week's council elections.

That result showed voters wanted power sharing to resume, said Ms O'Neill, saying suggestion that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) might return to power-sharing this autumn was ""not an acceptable timeframe"".

In an earlier letter to the largest parties, Northern Ireland Civil Service boss Jayne Brady said Northern Ireland's budgetary pressures had been compounded by a ""governance gap"".

Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill was joined by party colleague and former Finance Minister Conor Murphy at Stormont Castle

DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson described Thursday's meeting as productive, adding he was committed to working with other parties in asking for extra finances from Westminster.

""Our current funding formula for Northern Ireland doesn't work, what we need is a needs-based approach to our budget,"" he said.

Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Northern Ireland's funding model needed to be reformed

Stephen Farry from Stormont's third-largest party, the cross-community Alliance party, agreed it was a constructive meeting with parties committing themselves to work towards the restoration of Stormont.

He said a key aspect of that had to be requesting an extra £1bn from the Westminster government to ""stem the bleeding"" and stabilise public finances.

It's worth bearing in mind that the £1bn figure now being openly floated is a rough ballpark.

The parties haven't yet actually agreed on any final ask.

But Stormont sources say it reflects the scale of what is necessary to cover the £800m shortfall this year, plus outstanding pay deals for public sector workers, not to mention the t-word - transformation of services which already seems to be on the long finger.

Ultimately it will be up to the Treasury to agree to a collective ask put forward by the parties.

And we are told there are likely to be hefty strings attached.

Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said it was a sombre meeting because of the predicament of Northern Ireland's governance and fiscal position, but he welcomed the ""workman-like"" attitude from all parties.

Stormont officials believe they will need to find £800m in cuts and revenue-raising measures in the wake of last month's budget announcement which was set by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.

The task fell to Mr Heaton-Harris in the absence of a functioning Northern Ireland Executive.

Mr Heaton-Harris, who has denied setting a ""punishment budget"", has warned that government departments face difficult decisions ""in order to live within the funding available"".

The NI secretary said he was in close contact with parties about doing everything possible to lead to the restoration of the executive.

However, speaking after meeting with him on Wednesday, Michelle O'Neill said she didn't believe there was any urgency on his part.

Mr Heaton-Harris has refused to be drawn on a claim a restored Northern Ireland Executive needs an extra £1.1bn.

However, he said he was ""very pleased to hear the parties are talking about the future"".

He also said Ms O'Neill was ""completely wrong"" to claim he was showing no urgency to get devolved government restored.

On Thursday, Mr Heaton-Harris State met with the joint secretaries of the health trade unions to discuss the Northern Ireland budget for this financial year and the impact on the health service.

Chris Heaton-Harris has been accused of having ""no urgency"" on restoring Stormont

The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said he also offered clarity on the pay offer that was made to health workers in England and Wales earlier this month.

""Ultimately this is a matter for the trade unions and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland,"" a NIO spokesperson said.

""The Secretary of State has no authority to negotiate pay in Northern Ireland.

""Stable and accountable local government is the best way of delivering on the issues that matter most to the people of Northern Ireland, such as the health service.

""That is why the government's focus remains on restoring the Executive.""

On Thursday, it was announced that a shortage of consultants at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry means delivering inpatient care in general medicine is no longer sustainable.

The Southern Health Trust said it was working with other trusts in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health ""to help us through this situation"".

In her letter to Sinn Féin, the DUP, the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Ms Brady wrote that only elected ministers can take ""major policy dec"
55,"isions"", some of which are required for departments to make savings in the budget for 2023-24.

Civil service boss Jayne Brady says Stormont's spending trajectory currently exceeds the budget

Her letter warned that ""leaves the accounting officer in the invidious position of having no lawful means to ensure full compliance with the duty to remain within budget limits"".

""As a result, the spending trajectory currently exceeds the budget, and this will remain the case until and unless ministerial decision-making is restored,"" it added.

Ms Brady went on to emphasise that even if an executive was formed and accompanied by an additional financial package from Westminster, it was still ""highly likely"" that the budgetary position will remain very challenging.

""An incoming executive would be faced with a series of choices, made all the more challenging because they would fall to be taken part way through the financial year,"" she added.

Police in major US cities are preparing for potential unrest in case ex-President Donald Trump is arrested this week as part of a hush-money inquiry.

Authorities in New York, Washington DC and Los Angeles have ramped up their law enforcement presence.

A Manhattan prosecutor may charge Mr Trump over how he declared a payment to a porn star to keep quiet about an alleged affair.

It would be the first criminal case brought against a former US president.

Steel barricades were erected on Monday outside the prosecutor's office and the Manhattan Criminal Court, where Mr Trump could be charged, fingerprinted and photographed if charges are filed this week, as US media widely anticipate.

Increased police presence and barricades have also been seen outside Manhattan's Trump Tower.

Every member of the New York Police Department (NYPD), including plainclothes detectives, has been ordered to wear their full uniform on Tuesday and is being placed on standby to mobilise.

As of Tuesday morning, however, dozens of camera crews and reporters had taken over city sidewalks in the vicinity of the courthouse, outnumbering by far the handful of demonstrators who had shown up to voice their opinions on the potential indictment.

The NYPD and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force have been in touch with the US Secret Service, whose job it is to protect presidents and former presidents, about how a potential arrest might take place.

The Secret Service agents assigned to protect Mr Trump are expected to stay with him in the event of an arrest.

US media reports there will be no ""perp walk"" - when an arrested suspect is walked through a public place by officers, typically an opportunity for media to take photos and videos.

More police units were visible at Washington DC's Capitol Hill on Monday

The US Capitol Police, who protect lawmakers on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, has deployed bike rack fencing around the perimeter of the Capitol complex and will beef up staffing.

The Capitol Police plan to issue an emergency declaration on Tuesday, a congressional source told CBS. The order aims to increase co-ordination with other law enforcement agencies.

More civil disturbance officers will also be on standby, though the congressional source said there was no specific threat and that the order was proactive.

In Los Angeles, the LAPD and federal officials were preparing for a pro-Trump protest on Tuesday outside a federal building, the LA Times newspaper reports.

Police erect barricades outside the Manhattan court on Monday

US intelligence officials have detected an uptick in online threats against legal and government officials since Mr Trump wrote online on Saturday that he expected to be arrested on Tuesday.

Most of the threats were against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the man widely expected to file charges against Mr Trump.

On Saturday, the same day Mr Trump posted that his supporters should protest, Mr Bragg sent an email to staff.

""We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York,"" the prosecutor wrote.

Mr Bragg's case centres on a $130,000 payment from Mr Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to porn star Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Mr Trump years earlier.

His office is evaluating how the former president reimbursed Cohen. The record for the payment describes it as ""legal fees"" and prosecutors could argue this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records.

That is a misdemeanour in New York, typically resolved with a fine. But legal analysts say it could be upgraded to a more serious felony charge, which carries prison time, if prosecutors argue the lie was used in order to violate campaign laws.

The former president denies any wrongdoing and says he never had an affair with Ms Daniels.

A grand jury was convened in January to determine whether there is enough evidence to indict Mr Trump.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

On Monday, the grand jury heard from a Trump ally named Robert Costello who was called by the Trump team to undermine the prosecution's star witness, Cohen.

Mr Costello told reporters after emerging from two hours of testimony: ""I told the grand jury that this guy [Cohen] couldn't tell the truth if you put a gun to his head.""

He claimed Cohen, whom he used to work with, had once told him that Mr Trump was not aware of the payment to Ms Daniels.

After Mr Costello's testimony on Monday, Cohen hit back, saying that Mr Costello ""lacks any sense of veracity"".

Cohen was jailed in 2018 for multiple offences including violating campaign finance laws by not declaring the payment to Ms Daniels. Mr Trump has said he only learned of the payment much later.

In a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, Mr Trump said: ""In the history of our Country there cannot have been a more damaged or less credible witness at trial than fully disbarred lawyer and felon, Michael Cohen.""

The jury is expected to hear from at least one more witness on Wednesday before any charges are filed.

Mr Trump has vowed to continue his campaign for the 2024 presidential nomination even if he is indicted.

But 44% of Republicans said he should drop out of the presidential race if charged, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found on Monday.

Trump supporters have held protests outside his New York and Florida homes

The ""Barry Award"" had been named in honour of Barry Humphries

One of the world's top comedy festivals will no longer use comedian Barry Humphries' name for its chief prize, after he was accused of transphobia.

The Melbourne International Comedy Festival said its prestigious Barry Award for best show would be renamed.

Humphries, best known for his character Dame Edna Everage, has repeatedly drawn anger for his comments on transgender people - and later defended himself.

His remarks had ""definitely played a part"" in the change, the festival said.

Humphries, 85, has not responded to the festival's decision.

Last year, he drew criticism for describing being transgender as ""a fashion"".

In another controversy, he claimed to have been speaking in character when he referred to gender-reassignment surgery as ""self-mutilation"" in a 2016 interview with The Telegraph. He also described Caitlyn Jenner as a ""publicity-seeking rat-bag"".

He has previously said his comments were misinterpreted, but they have been criticised by other high-profile comedians - including former Barry Award winner Hannah Gadsby.

Barry Hum"
56,"phries claimed he was in character as Dame Edna in a 2016 interview

Humphries co-founded the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 1987, and it is now one of the world's premier comedy events. Its top prize has been named in his honour since 2000.

On Tuesday, festival director Susan Provan said in a statement: ""It is time for the award for most outstanding show to be in our name to celebrate the city that inspired the growth of our festival and its outstanding artists.""

She told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Humphries' recent comments were ""not helpful"" and had helped instigate the decision.

Gadsby criticised Humphries when she accepted the award in 2017 for her show Nanette, now a worldwide success on Netflix.

""I don't agree with a lot of the things Barry Humphries has said recently,"" she said at the time.

""It is not something I will walk past. With full respect, I would like to accept this award just for me.""

Previous winners of the award include Ross Noble, The Mighty Boosh, Demetri Martin and Nina Conti.

Criminal charges have been dropped against Alec Baldwin over a fatal on-set shooting in October 2021.

The Emmy-award winning actor was charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter over the incident during the filming of Rust in New Mexico.

Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed by a live bullet fired from a prop gun that was being used by Baldwin.

The development comes less than two weeks before a trial was set to begin.

A statement released by New Mexico special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis said that ""over the last few days... new facts were revealed"" in the case, requiring further investigation.

""This decision does not absolve Mr Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,"" the statement continued, adding: ""Our follow-up investigation will remain active and ongoing.""

A lawyer for Mr Baldwin praised the move by prosecutors.

""We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident,"" his lawyer, Luke Nikas, told the BBC in a statement.

Mr Baldwin had been practising firing the gun on set at a ranch near Santa Fe when it went off, fatally striking 42-year-old Ukrainian-born Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.

The actor denied pulling the trigger, although an FBI report later concluded that the gun could not have been fired without the trigger being pulled.

He had been due in court for a preliminary hearing on 3 May.

The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is also facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter. The statement from the special prosecutors says the charges against her remain unchanged.

A lawyer for Ms Gutierrez-Reed told BBC News that they ""fully expect at the end of this process that Hannah will also be exonerated"".

According to the LA Times, prosecutors had recently learned that the gun used in the shooting, a .45 Colt revolver, had been modified with a new trigger in a way that could have made a misfire more likely.

Thursday's statement by prosecutors made no mention of the gun, but said that the newly revealed facts ""demand further investigation and forensic analysis"".

Prosecutors had accused Mr Baldwin, 65, of showing a ""reckless"" disregard for the safety of his colleagues.

Mr Nikas, a lawyer for the star of The Hunt for Red October, previously called the initial decision to charge his client ""a terrible miscarriage of justice"".

""Mr Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun - or anywhere on the movie set,"" Mr Nikas said.

""He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds.""

In an Instagram post after the announcement was made, the 30 Rock actor thanked his lawyer and his wife, Hilaria Baldwin.

""I owe everything I have to this woman. (and to you, Luke),"" he posted.

In order to have been found guilty prosecutors would have had to convince a jury that he had acted with ""criminal negligence"".

If convicted, he could have faced up to 18 months in prison.

The Santa Fe district attorney had initially added a firearm enhancement charge, which could have added five years to his sentence.

But it was dropped after prosecutors determined that the enhancement law was not in place at the time of the shooting.

The decision to drop the charges comes on the same day that Rust resumed filming - 18 months after the shooting.

Melina Spadone, a lawyer for Rust Movie Productions, said new rules on the set ""will bar any use of working weapons and any form of ammunition"".

""Live ammunition is - and always was - prohibited on set.""

According to Variety magazine, Mr Baldwin is currently filming Rust on location in Montana.

Hutchins' widower, Matthew, will be an executive producer. Baldwin last October reached a settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by her family.

Rust Movie productions, which Baldwin is part of, said in February the scene that was being rehearsed when Hutchins was shot has now been rewritten.

The stark, emotional video for Nothing Compares 2 U was an MTV staple in 1990

In 1990, Sinéad O'Connor scored a worldwide hit with Nothing Compares 2 U, a song of unspeakable loss and heartbreak.

It was the defining moment of her career - one that thrust her unwillingly into the mainstream.

But the story of the video, and how she came to record it, is full of surprising twists and turns.

After her death at the age of 56, here's a closer look at how she recorded her most famous song.

It's 15 July, 1984 and Prince has just flown back from Dallas, where he watched the Jacksons' Victory tour. As soon as he steps off the plane, he heads to the recording studio.

There, with only his engineer Susan Rogers in attendance, he writes and records the initial version of Nothing Compares 2 U in a matter of hours.

""I was amazed at how beautiful it was,"" Rogers told Duane Tudahl, in his book Prince & The Purple Rain studio sessions.

""He took his notebook and he went off to the bedroom, wrote the lyrics very quickly, came back out and sang it. I was very impressed with it.""

Rogers theorised that the song was written about Prince's housekeeper, Sandy Scipioni, who had been forced to quit when her father died unexpectedly of a heart attack.

""Sandy was the person who made sure he had his favourite beverage, which was Five Alive, and she made sure the house was clean, and that there were fresh flowers on the piano, and that the socks and underwear were washed,"" Rogers told BBC 6 Music in 2018.

""She had been gone and Prince's mood was getting darker and darker. He would just ask, 'When is Sandy coming back?' That might have been the inspiration for the song.""

Prince's friend, Jerome Benton, had a different story - saying Prince wrote the song for him after he split up with his fiancée.

Either way, the musician felt the song didn't suit his public image at the time. He decided to give it away to The Family, a band he'd formed around his then-girlfriend Susannah Melvoin, and the singer Paul Peterson.

Prince removed his vocals, added some orchestral overdubs and handed the song over. It was released on The Family's sole album in 1985, which promptly tanked, and the group split up.

Nothing Compares 2 U was never released as a single, and seemed destined for obscurity until Sinéad O'Connor's manager, Fachtna O'Ceallaigh, remembered it and suggested she cover it for her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got"
57,".

Other accounts suggest she was introduced to the song by Steve Fargnoli, who had looked after Prince in the Purple Rain era, and took over as O'Connor's manager around the time of the recording.

Either way, O'Connor immediately connected with the track. She and O'Ceallaigh were a couple, but their relationship was on the rocks. Prince's lovelorn lyrics matched her own state of mind. If he was gone, she could do whatever she wanted, she could see whomever she chose - but nothing would compare to him.

""They were in the process of breaking up when we recorded Nothing Compares 2 U,"" said Chris Birkett, who co-produced and engineered the song, in an interview with Sound On Sound.

""That's probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song. It mirrored her situation.""

At this point, it's a good idea to go and listen to The Family's original recording or Prince's demo, which was released in 2018. The song is there, but it's all dressed up in Paisley finery. Every line ends with a baroque piano figure, the bridge is drowning in syrupy strings, there's even a saxophone solo.

Whatever emotion Prince was channelling, he did his best to hide it. O'Connor did the opposite.

Working with Japanese jazz virtuoso Gota Yashiki and Soul II Soul producer Nellee Hooper, she put a line through all the ornate R&B flourishes and pared the song back its bare essentials.

The arrangement is simple - a drum loop, some gauzy strings and a haunting choir of backing vocals. They're pushed and pulled by the tidal wave of her voice, like sand on a beach, as she wrestles with various stages of devastation.

She starts quietly, almost cowering as she sings: ""It's been seven hours and 15 days since you took your love away."" Then she's defiant: ""Since you been gone, I can do whatever I want"" but her bravado collapses into anguish once she realises that ""nothing will take away these blues"".

By the chorus, she's face to face with grief. Her voice strives for power, but it cracks again. Then, In a change to Prince's melody, she shifts the pitch of the final ""to you"" to a despondent monotone, the dissonance illustrating her pain.

It's one of the all-time great vocal performances.

O'Connor's other hits include Mandinka, I Am Stretched On Your Grave and Thank You For Hearing Me

In O'Connor's hands, Nothing Compares 2 U was always going to be a hit, but the video made it a phenomenon.

Director John Maybury shot several hours of footage of the singer walking through a washed-out Paris. You can see glimpses of it in the finished promo - O'Connor dressed in black, reflected in the Seine, walking through the stunning Parc de Saint-Cloud.

But once she'd performed the song to the camera, Maybury knew her close-up had to be the focus.

From the beginning, O'Connor stares straight at us, her pale green eyes peering out of the screen, searching for connection. But as she sings, she breaks eye contact, glancing down, as though she's unable to keep her emotions in check.

At the end, famously, two tears roll down her cheeks.

Those tears were genuine, and they represented a loss Prince could never have imagined when he wrote Nothing Compares 2 U in the middle of his Purple Rain hot streak.

O'Connor's mother had died in a car crash in 1986, when the singer was still a teenager. They had not had an easy relationship. O'Connor later accused her of being mentally and physically abusive. But when she sang Prince's final verse, all that grief came flooding back.

""All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard / All died when you went away/ I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard / But I'm willing to give it another try.""

That's the moment that prompted those tears.

""I didn't know I was going to cry when I sang in the video because I didn't cry in the studio recording it,"" she later recalled.

""[But] every time I sing that song I think of my mother. I never stop crying for my mother. I couldn't face being in Ireland for 13 years because of it.""

Prince reportedly didn't like O'Connor's version - maybe because it outsold all of his own songs in the UK and the US.

When O'Connor finally met him, the animosity seemed real. In her 2021 memoir, she said he told her off for swearing in interviews, then challenged her to a pillow fight, only to bash her with something hard he'd slipped into his pillowcase.

Despite that, she still held Nothing Compares 2U in great reverence,

""It's really about emotions, it's not about notes,"" she told BBC 6 Music in 2016.

""I think I'm probably similar to millions of people who loved the song, and we're all people who associated the song with a loss of some kind.""

The High Court ruled that some lawsuits had been submitted too late to proceed

Hugh Grant is set to take the Sun newspaper on in court over claims it used illegal methods to gather stories about him.

The actor believes private investigators working for the Sun tapped his phone, bugged his house and car, and burgled his home.

The Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) unsuccessfully argued his action should be blocked because he waited too long to launch it.

NGN denies the claims against it.

A judge was asked to rule on whether Mr Grant's lawsuit should be allowed to proceed because it dates back further than six years, the cut-off point for legal action of this kind in civil courts.

This time limitation has become a major legal battleground in cases against newspapers, because allegations of wrongdoing often go back 30 years.

Publishers attempt to argue that cases should not go to trial because alleged victims of unlawful newsgathering delayed their legal action.

But Mr Grant argued he should be allowed to bring the case now because material he and his lawyers will rely on only came to light in recent years.

Some of the evidence against the newspaper was contained in a 2021 witness statement made by private investigator Gavin Burrows.

It was only when NGN disclosed invoices for their payments to Mr Burrows around the same time that Mr Grant had access to potential evidence which could help him win his case in court.

In his judgement, Mr Justice Fancourt acknowledged that the 62-year-old actor and privacy campaigner had long believed that private investigators had been paid to look into his affairs.

The judge said there was a realistic chance Mr Grant would establish at trial that, before seeing the 2021 evidence, ""he could not reasonably have believed with sufficient confidence that he may have been targeted by [private investigators] instructed by the Sun"".

This judgment does not mean the issue of whether Mr Grant's claim is too late has been decided, but it will now be considered at the trial next year.

In a statement released through his lawyer, Mr Grant said: ""I am pleased that my case will be allowed to go to trial, which is what I have always wanted - because it is necessary that the truth comes out about the activities of the Sun.

""As my case makes clear, the allegations go far wider and deeper than voicemail interception.""

Mr Grant's statement in the case claims that for years newspaper published News UK lied about its involvement in phone hacking and illegal information gather"
58,"ing.

He said the company had a ""vast, long-lasting and deliberate policy strategy plan of false denials and other concealment in relation to the Sun, to prevent me, and others in a similar position, from bringing claims against them"".

This included, he said, false denials to the Leveson Inquiry into Press Standards, a press complaints body, and in public statements.

While the actor was successful in securing his day in court on part of his claim, the court refused Mr Grant permission to sue NGN for allegedly hacking his phone voicemails, as the judge ruled he could have brought a case much earlier.

NGN said it was ""pleased that, following our application, the High Court has ruled that Mr Grant is statute-barred from bringing a phone hacking claim against The Sun.""

""NGN strongly denies the various historical allegations of unlawful information gathering contained in what remains of Mr Grant's claim.""

A similar legal argument centred on the claims of the Duke of Sussex is due to be heard by the High Court in July.

Taylor Swift will be performing in Cardiff next June

Tickets for Taylor Swift's 2024 Cardiff gig are already being listed for £3,352 on resale websites.

Labour MP Kevin Brennan expressed his shock in the Parliament, saying his daughter was a ""Swiftie"".

He asked Commons leader Penny Mordaunt why the UK government ""hasn't done more to protect our daughters from this sort of rip-off merchants"".

Ms Mordaunt encouraged him to ""raise that matter with the Secretary of State"" before the summer recess.

The US superstar will perform at the Principality Stadium on 18 June 2024 as part of her Eras Tour.

The MP may avoid a cruel summer as Ms Mordaunt told him there was one further Department for Culture, Media and Sport questions before the recess.

During business questions, he asked for a debate on the practice, saying more should be done to protect young people.

The MP for Cardiff West said: ""Could we have a debate on secondary ticketing because, as a father of a Swiftie, and I know the deputy shadow leader is also a mother of a Swiftie, I was appalled to see that within an hour of tickets going on sale for the Taylor Swift concert at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, a ticket was on sale in the lower tier for £3,352 on Viagogo.

""Why hasn't the government done more to protect our daughters from this sort of rip-off merchants?""

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has been arrested by Dutch police at a protest in The Hague.

The 21-year-old joined hundreds of protesters in a march against fossil fuel subsidies on Saturday.

The protest devolved into a standoff as dozens of police officers, some on horseback, attempted to stop protesters from blocking a main road.

Local police put Ms Thunberg on a bus full of demonstrators and she was driven away from the scene.

Protesters had planned to block The Hague's A12 highway for what Extinction Rebellion (XR) organisers say was the 37th time. The road has been subject to regular blockades since 2022.

The demonstration was called to denounce the Dutch government's tax concessions for companies connected to the fossil fuel industry, including the energy firm, Shell, and the airline, KLM.

Activists hoped to pile pressure on the government ahead of a planned debate about fossil fuel subsidies in June.

Extinction Rebellion organisers say this is the 37th time they have protested on the A12 highway

Flanked by fellow activists, Ms Thunberg marched towards the designated protest spot behind a banner with the words, STOP FOSSIL SUBSIDIES.

The world's most recognizable climate activist tried to blend in with the crowd, but her star-power meant this demonstration attracted more attention than previous XR blockades of the A12 highway.

A brass band played and the protesters sang traditional Dutch songs given a modern climate-conscious twist.

Some newspapers had claimed local residents were annoyed the climate protest was taking place on the hottest day of the year so far, potentially making it harder for people to reach the beach in The Hague.

A group of activists then marched from the city centre to a field next to the highway, where a wall of local police officers was waiting for them.

A few demonstrators broke through police lines but were quickly picked up and handcuffed.

""It's important to demonstrate today because we are living in a state of planetary emergency,"" Ms Thunberg told AFP news agency.

""We must do everything to avoid that crisis and to save human lives.""

Asked whether she was concerned about police action, she said: ""Why should I be?""

Ms Thunberg was among a small group of climate activists who broke away and managed to reach the road. More than a hundred of them were placed in police-commandeered minibuses.

The Swedish activist described her arrest as 'peaceful'. She sat at the back and chatted before being driven away.

At previous protests in The Hague, police have driven detainees away from a protest's epicentre and released them without further consequences.

Those, including Ms Thunberg, who managed to separate from the colourful crowd and sit down cross-legged on the A12 highway, were first asked by police if they wanted to cooperate by boarding the buses. Those who refused were hoisted up by arms and rucksacks and deposited in the vehicles.

Later on Saturday, reports emerged that Ms Thunberg had returned to the protest and been arrested for a second time.

Police told the BBC some people who were arrested and released were then arrested again. They did not confirm if Ms Thunberg was among them.

As of about 14:00 local time (12:00 GMT), traffic was still flowing on the A12, according to the Netherlands' Algemeen Dagblad newspaper.

The Hague's local police told the BBC: ""While we can't comment on individual cases, we can confirm that all of the people who were picked up by police and put on to minibuses were officially arrested, because they were blocking the highway and that is against the law.""

Ms Thunberg has been a leading climate campaigner since she was 15 years old.

In February, she and four co-defendants were found not guilty of breaking the law when they refused to follow police instructions during a climate demonstration in London.

Timothy Schofield has been found guilty of 11 sexual offences involving a child

The brother of television presenter Phillip Schofield has been found guilty of sexually abusing a boy.

Timothy Schofield, 54, from Bath denied 11 sexual offences involving a child between October 2016 and October 2019.

Schofield, who was a civilian worker for Avon and Somerset Police at the time of the offences, was found guilty of all charges.

Phillip Schofield said after the verdict: ""As far as I am concerned, I no longer have a brother.""

The jury at Exeter Crown Court found him guilty with a majority of 10-2 after more than five-and-a-half hours' deliberating.

In a statement released by his lawyer, Phillip Schofield said his brother had committed a ""despicable"" crime.

""My overwhelming concern is and has always been for the wellbeing of the victim and his family. I hope that their privacy will now be respected.""

Schofield arrived each day in court covering his head

During the trial, Timothy Schofield denied performing sexual acts on the boy but admitted he had watched pornography with the teenager and they had masturbated while sitting apart.

The jury previously heard how he had confessed to his"
59,"TV star brother in September 2021 about watching pornography with the teenager on one occasion, claiming it had happened after the boy was 16, the age of consent.

Phillip Schofield described in a written statement read to the court how his brother had phoned him in an agitated and upset state, and Mr Schofield had invited him to drive to his home in London.

He told how his brother said ""You are going to hate me for what I am about to say"", with him assuring him there was nothing he could say that would do that.

Mr Schofield said in the statement: ""Then he said that he and [the boy] had time together and that last year they had watched porn ... and [masturbated]"".

""I turned and said, 'What did you just say?' He said it was last year and we were alone together. Tim said it was just this once. I told him it should never happen again. He then started to tell me about [the boy's] body.

""I said, 'F***, stop'. I shouted at Tim that he had to stop. I didn't want to know any of the details but he made it sound like a one-off.

""I said, 'I don't want you to tell me any more'. I said, 'You've got to stop, just never do it again. Regardless how that happened, it must never happen again'.""

The This Morning presenter's statement issued after the guilty verdict on Monday said: ""If any crime had ever been confessed to me by my brother, I would have acted immediately to protect the victim and their family,"" adding that he welcomed the guilty verdicts.

Robin Shellard, prosecuting, told the court the boy's evidence showed the abuse in fact began when he was aged 13.

Timothy Schofield has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Bristol Crown Court on 19 May.

His employer, Avon & Somerset Police, said it would now start misconduct proceedings against him.

Schofield was suspended from duty in December 2021 when the criminal proceedings started.

Senior Investigating Officer Det Insp Keith Smith said: ""[Schofield] has exploited and abused the victim by carrying out a sickening series of offences over a significant period of time.""

""Although the defendant does not work in a public-facing role, and the offences are not linked to his employment, we know the fact he works for the police will be a matter of public concern,"" he added.

Schofield was convicted of three counts of causing a child to watch sexual activity, three of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, three of causing a child to engage in sexual activity and two of sexual activity with a child.

The victim told the jury he felt ""emotionally blackmailed"" by Timothy Schofield and ""forced"" to participate in sexual activity.

He said: ""I felt that emotionally there was no escape from what we had to do and I felt that there was a tremendous amount of pressure and expectation for me to fulfil what was being asked and wanted.""

An NSPCC spokesperson said Schofield's actions were ""deeply harmful"".

They added: ""Child sexual abuse can have devastating and long-lasting impact on a person's life. We hope that the young man he targeted is receiving all the support he needs to move forward with his life.""

George Gilbey appeared on Gogglebox with his mother Linda Gilbey and stepfather Pete McGarry

The mother of Gogglebox star George Gilbey, who died after a fall at work, has paid tribute to her ""generous, funny and kind"" son.

Gilbey, who appeared on the show with his mum Linda McGarry and stepdad Pete, died on 27 March after a fall in Shoeburyness, Southend-on-Sea.

McGarry told the Clacton Gazette he was a ""devoted father"" who had ""buckets of personality"".

A man has been arrested in connection with the death.

Flowers could be seen at the gates to EGL Homecare the morning after Gilbey's death

McGarry said the electrician and roofer had only been back at work for three days when he died.

She said: ""I'm devastated - he was like my best friend.

""He had the best heart in the world - he was generous, funny and kind, with bundles of charm and buckets of personality.""

Gilbey ""did more in his 40 years than people do in 90"", she said.

His stepfather died in 2021 after a short illness.

""He just couldn't get over the death of Pete,"" said McGarry.

""I have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and he took it worse than me. He was a mummy's boy.

George Gilbey, his mother Linda and late stepfather, Pete, were fixtures on the Channel 4 show between 2013 and 2018

""George was a real contradiction - he was so funny and so intelligent. A lot of people don't know how intelligent George was.

""He was smart, which allowed him to be quick-witted, and he was loud and outgoing, but at the same time very sensitive. He helped others, but he struggled himself.""

Gilbey featured in eight series of the Channel 4 show between 2013 and 2018.

He also appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in 2014.

A man arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter has been released under investigation.

Shares in several regional banks in the US have dropped sharply, as investors fear the banking crisis that has gripped financial markets is not over.

The falls come a day after the collapse of First Republic, which was seized by regulators and sold after worried customers withdrew more than $100bn.

It was the second biggest bank failure in US history and the third since March.

Shareholders were wiped out - and are now eyeing risks at other banks.

California-based PacWest Bancorp, which has been under scrutiny for its lending to firms backed by venture capital, saw shares plunge 28%.

The turmoil comes as the banking sector is adjusting to a sharp rise in interest rates.

The US central bank has raised its benchmark rate from near zero last March to more than 4.75%. It is expected to announce another 0.25% increase this week.

The moves are impacting the US economy, which could hurt banks as businesses and households start to struggle to make debt payments.

Many analysts are worried about risks to banks lurking in the commercial property sector, which has been hit by a fall in demand for office space due to the expansion of remote work.

The rise in interest rates has put some banks in a bind, as higher rates hurt the market value of some debts issued when borrowing costs were lower.

The fears intensified in March, when panic sparked by the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank - then the US's 16th largest lender - prompted global sell-offs of bank shares and led many US bank customers to shift their money to firms seen as safer.

Bigger banks proved to be the winners, while regional firms came under pressure.

The fears claimed Signature Bank and ultimately First Republic, which could not survive the loss of funds.

PacWest reported last month that its deposits shrunk 16% from the end of December to the end of March, while Western Alliance shares fell 11%.

Both banks said they had seen deposits start to increase again more recently as the fears subsided.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, which bought First Republic from the government, said on Monday that he thought the fall of First Republic marked the end to ""this part"" of the crisis.

""This part of the crisis is over,"" he said. ""Down the road, there are rates going way up, real estate, recession - that's a whole different issue, but for"
60,"now, everyone should just take a deep breath.""

Analysts have said the US banking system - which has more than 4,000 banks - could be poised for a wave of consolidation as the economy weakens.

They have compared the situation to the 1980s, when hundreds of lenders closed after being caught off guard by a sharp rise in interest rates and bad commercial property loans.

""It's primarily been an interest rate problem but if we slide into a recession, it could be a double whammy,"" said banking consultant Bert Ely.

""I think maybe heads are screwed on a little bit better than they were in the 80s but there's still lots of uncertainty that's out there.""

Police moved to arrest a group of protesters in Piccadilly as the annual Pride parade got under way

Five Just Stop Oil protesters have been charged over demonstrations which briefly led to London's annual Pride parade being delayed.

Images on social media on Saturday showed police removing demonstrators who managed to briefly stop the march.

Seven people were arrested by the Metropolitan Police. Five have since been charged and two have been bailed.

The five people, aged between 20 and 68, have been charged with Public Order offences.

They are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.

Police said the five charged are Ben Plumpton, 68, of Underbank Ave, Charlestown, Calderdale; Zosia Lewis, 22, of Melbourne Street, Newcastle upon Tyne; Oliver Clegg, 20, of Olney Street, Manchester; Gosse Bootsma, 25, of no fixed address, and Callum Goode, 23, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire.

Organisers estimated about 30,000 participants from across 600 organisations took part in the parade

In addition, two males, aged 19 and 22 have been released on bail pending further enquiries, the Met added.

This year's Pride procession started at midday at Hyde Park Corner and people peacefully made their way through Westminster's streets before it finished at Whitehall Place.

A number of stages hosted performances from LGBTQ+ acts as part of the celebrations.

Taylor Swift has joined Elon Musk as ranking among the world's wealthiest people, according to a new rich list.

The American pop star entered the Forbes World's Billionaires List for the first time with $1.1bn (£877m), along with Sam Altman, creator of the AI chatbot ChatGPT on $1bn (£800m).

LVMH French luxury goods titan Bernard Arnault and his family topped the chart with an estimated $233bn (£185bn).

Forbes said there were a record 2,781 billionaires for 2024.

The figure is 141 more than last year and 26 more than the previous record set in 2021. Forbes added the elite were richer than ever - with a collective wealth of $14.2tn (£11.3tn).

Singer-songwriter Swift entered the rich list after achieving megastar status. She stole the show at this year's Grammy Awards, becoming the first performer to win the prize for album of the year four times.

Her album 1989 (Taylor's Version) was also the best-selling vinyl LP of last year.

Swift's success is not just confined to the world of music. Her mere presence at American football games to watch her boyfriend Travis Kelce has been credited with raising NFL viewing figures.

When it comes to the top 10 richest people on the planet, eight listed were from the US - six of whom had made their money in technology industries.

After Frenchman Mr Arnault and his family, Mr Musk, the owner of Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, is listed second, with an estimated net worth of $195bn (£155bn).

He is followed in third by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos.

Mr Musk's riches are up 8% from last year but down on his net worth in November 2021, when he became the first person ever to be worth $300bn (£239bn).

Also joining Forbes's list is basketball legend Magic Johnson with wealth of $1.2bn (£950m) and TV producer Dick Wolf, behind the US Law and Order and Chicago PD series, also on $1.2bn.

Chase Peterson-Withorn, senior editor on wealth for Forbes, said it had been an ""amazing"" year for the world's richest people.

""A record-breaking 14 centi-billionaires have 12-figure fortunes. Even during times of financial uncertainty for many, the super-rich continue to thrive,"" he added.

Forbes said the class of billionaires for 2024 were 255% richer than a decade ago, now worth $2tn (£1.59tn) in all, meaning just 0.5% of the world's 2,781 billionaires hold 14% of all billionaire wealth.

Geographically, the US still has more billionaires than any other country, with a record 813 on the list. China remains second, followed by India.

In the UK, hedge fund manager Michael Platt is the richest person, followed by part-owner of Manchester United Sir Jim Ratcliffe and inventor Sir James Dyson.

Forbes said 189 people had fallen off the list including 129 from mainland China, where weak consumer spending and a collapse in the real estate market wiped billions off portfolios.

Another 32 billionaires died, including Egyptian tycoon Mohamed Al-Fayed, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, former Chilean President Sebastián Piñera and Margaritaville singer Jimmy Buffett.

One care home in Scotland is closing every week on average, industry leaders have warned.

Scottish Care, which represents private operators, said the industry was in an ""incredibly difficult"" position due to funding and staffing challenges.

And smaller, family-run homes in rural areas are the most vulnerable to closure, the body added.

A new funding deal between care homes and council umbrella body Cosla has been agreed.

But care homes argue the 6% uplift does not go far enough to cover increased energy and recruitment costs.

Speaking to the BBC Scotland Sunday Show, Karen Hedge, deputy chief executive of Scottish Care, said the deal was the best Cosla could realistically offer but still ""doesn't cut it"".

She said: ""It is incredibly difficult right now, I'm having phone calls from our members in tears who are having to close what has been a family business for them for many years.

""What we are seeing as a result of that is the impact on the residents and their loved ones, who in some places are having to drive up to two hours to go to another care home in a different community.""

As well as more homes closing, Ms Hedge said care at home packages were also being impacted by private operators not being able to meet the increased costs in what she described as another example of ""the way social care is a Cinderella service compared to the NHS"".

Adam Stachura, head of policy and communications at Age Scotland, said the care home closure figures ""should be setting alarm bells ringing across the country"".

He added: ""Social care is critical to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people - it is incredibly worrying and I actually don't understand how it will get better.

""The vast majority of care homes are provided by private organisations, there are very few council-run care homes any more.

""So one closing every week is devastating because where on earth do these people go?""

The National Care Home Contract (NCHC) was set up about 15 years ago in response to disputes over rates between care homes, local and central government.

Those fees are now set through annual negotiation between Scottish Care and Cosla, which represents local authorities.

A 6% uplift has been agreed but some in the industry say this was borne out of sheer desperation for more funding to keep going.

Plans for a new national care service in Scotland, which would see a series of regional care boards set up that would operate in the same way as health boards,"
61,"have been postponed.

The new service would see Scottish government ministers directly responsible for social care services instead of local councils.

However, uncertainty about the costs involved in setting up and running the new service and the implications for local decision-making remain.

A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The national care home rate is not set by the Scottish government and is negotiated by Cosla and Scottish Care.

""We are pleased that Scottish Care members have agreed to accept the 6% uplift offer from Cosla to agree the national care home contract.""

Activists on both sides of the abortion debate outside the Supreme Court

Less than a year after its landmark decision reversing constitutional abortion protections, a majority of the nine justices of the US Supreme Court seem reluctant to jump back into the politically charged subject anytime soon.

The court was reviewing a decision by a federal judge in Texas that suspended approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the abortion drug mifepristone, one of the most commonly used methods of terminating a pregnancy in America.

The court threw out that decision, as well as a ruling by a federal appeals court that would have limited use of the drug to women less than seven weeks pregnant, and required three in-person physician visits for those seeking the drug, and prevented its availability by post.

The court's ruling was short and to the point. The current rules governing mifepristone remain in effect until the Supreme Court eventually does decide on the merits of the original Texas order, or (less likely) lets whatever the appeals court decides stand without review.

This effectively kicks the can down the road months and possibly well into 2024, when a final court decision could come down in the shadow of the next presidential election.

Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, openly dissented from the majority. The latter went into detail on why he would have let the Fifth Circuit's appeal court's ruling stand.

He wrote that the circuit court's stay would not have caused ""irreparable harm"" to the FDA or to Danco Laboratories, which manufactures the drug.

Neither Mr Alito nor the majority decision expressed any opinion about mifepristone's ultimate fate. Given the conservative-leaning court's abortion ruling last year, however, its final decision in the case could very well anger the abortion-rights groups that on Friday were celebrating.

The case is now back in the hands of the Fifth Circuit appeals court, where six of its 16 judges were appointed by Donald Trump and only four by Democratic presidents.

Last week, two Trump-selected judges on that court issued a lengthy opinion that, among other things, said it was ""unlikely"" that the challenge to at least some of the FDA's decisions authorising mifepristone would fail. A third judge (appointed by former Republican President George W Bush) disagreed.

Those three judges will hear oral arguments in the case in May and could issue a decision weeks or even months later. That ruling could then be reviewed by the full 15-judge circuit before the losing side has the opportunity to appeal to the US Supreme Court.

There is a likelihood that when this case once again lands on the steps of the high court, it will do so with a ruling that curtails the availability of the abortion drug.

Even that, however, could be just the beginning.

This current legal battle is just over a temporary hold on the FDA's mifepristone approval. Once this round of appeals has concluded, the case will head back to the Texas court for a trial on the merits of the case, possibly with witness testimony.

After that court issues its final decision, the appeals process will start all over again.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Meanwhile, the opinion of the general public continues to land heavily in favour of existing policies relating to the abortion pill. A recent Ipsos poll found 68% of Americans opposed overturning approval of the abortion drug versus only 28% in favour. Republican voters were split, with 53% in favour and 46% opposed.

A majority of Americans view the Supreme Court sceptically when it comes to abortion, with 57% saying the chamber is politically motivated on the topic, while only 37% trust that the justices will remain ""neutral and impartial"".

Friday's order may allow some of those emotions, and attitudes towards the court, to cool in the coming months. But the court's abortion ruling last June has opened the door to numerous legal challenges to state-level abortion rights and restrictions, as well as to federal policies like the mifepristone rules.

Mr Alito, in his opinion last June, wrote that ""it is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives"", but this is far from the last time the nine justices will have to weigh in on the matter.

More seasonal workers will be allowed into the UK if needed, the prime minister has said after the home secretary said migration must fall.

Rishi Sunak told a gathering of farmers and other food producers an extra 10,000 visas will be made available for the agriculture sector.

This would be on top of the current 45,000 allocated.

But on Monday, Suella Braverman said there was no reason the UK could not train its own fruit pickers.

At a speech, the home secretary said it was ""not racist"" to want to control borders and her aim was to reduce net migration.

On Tuesday, Mr Sunak said the government was responding to the needs of farmers by offering the extra visas.

Asked by Farming Today on BBC Radio 4 why the number of visas was not higher, Mr Sunak said: ""I think the number is appropriate.

""We haven't used the 45,000 allocation last year. Before we start saying we need more it's reasonable to extend the current numbers.""

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the extra visa numbers were also offered to the agricultural sector last year.

Around 70 leading members of the food industry, including farmers and supermarket bosses, met with the prime minister and his colleagues to talk about how the UK can improve the way it produces and sells food.

It comes against a backdrop of continued high prices, and new research from the consumer group Which? that said the price of some goods had jumped by as much as 25% in April, compared with the same month last year.

Dairy products such as cheese saw the biggest rise, the group said.

Overall, in a survey of the UK's eight largest supermarkets looking at 26,000 products, it said food prices rose more than 17%.

Supermarkets are starting to bring down the prices of bread and butter but Which? said prices remained at ""shockingly high levels"" compared with last year.

It also found supermarket own-label budget items were up 25% in April compared with the same period 12 months ago.

The consumer group said it was ""concerned the voices of millions of people"" struggling with soaring food inflation had not been heard at the summit.

""Families up and down the country are facing a daily struggle to put food on the table and it's clear the big supermarkets could...make available a range of healthy budget foods available in all shops,"" it said.

Earlier on Tuesday, Tesco announced that it was cutting prices of vegetable and sunflower oil, as well as pasta by 15p. But a 500g bag of penne pasta is still 80p - in 2021, it was 50p.

However, Bill Grimsey, the former boss of frozen food chain Iceland, warned: ""If anybody thinks prices are going to come down quickly anytime soon, well they're not.""

Farmers and businesses have been hit by rising operating costs, in part caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Other expenses such as shipping costs - which soared during the Covid pandemic - have since fallen but Mr Grimsey said shoppers are unlikely to see the impact of this on the prices they pay.

The government also pledged to put greater emphasis on farmers' interests in future trade deals and said it would review horticulture and egg supply chains to"
62,"""ensure farmers get a fair price for their produce"".

Many farmers have argued that supermarkets are not giving them a fair deal for certain goods, such as eggs.

Ash Amirahmadi, managing director of the UK's largest dairy producer Arla Foods, attended the summit and told the BBC the meeting was a ""good start"", but added that the government needed to ""follow through"" on its commitment to prioritise the UK's food industry.

Arla managing director Ash Amirahmadi said high food price inflation was being felt across the world

Mr Amirahmadi said burgeoning costs in the sector were not unique to the UK and were about 40% up before inflation first started rising, though he cautioned against a return to the days of cheap milk.

""I expect when we fully come out of this prices will be higher than they were before,"" he added.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents retailers, has said they are ""doing all they can to keep food prices as low as possible"" and called on the government to streamline regulation around recycling, packaging and Brexit to try to bring down prices for consumers.

The number of people living with major illnesses in England will rise nine times faster than the healthy working age population, projections show.

By 2040 nearly one in five will have health conditions such as dementia and cancer, up from one in six in 2019.

The Health Foundation, which did the analysis, said the population shift would have a major impact on the NHS.

The think tank said it would require a radical shift, with more care in the community, rather than hospitals.

The projections suggest there will be 9.1 million people with a major health condition by 2040, a 37% rise in the latest data from 2019.

By comparison, the number of healthy working-age people will increase by just 4%.

Most of the increase is being driven by the ageing population, but there will be growing numbers of young people living in ill health too, the report said.

There will be particularly big increases in people living with anxiety and depression, chronic pain and diabetes.

Obesity is one of the major factors that will drive rises in illnesses.

This will more than offset the gains made by fewer people smoking, and lower cholesterol levels.

Lead researcher Anita Charlesworth said: ""The challenge of an ageing population with rising levels of major illness is not unique to the NHS.

""Countries across the globe face the same pressures. How well prepared we are to meet the challenge is what will set us apart.

""Over the next two decades, the growth in major illness will place additional demand on all parts of the NHS.

""But the impact will extend well beyond the health service too - and has significant implications for other public services, the labour market and the public finances.""

She said while living with a major health condition would not necessarily exclude everyone from the workforce, many would be excluded.

Dr Layla McCay, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health managers, said the projections were ""worrying"" given the increased pressure and demand on the NHS which the changes would lead to.

She said there needed to be a greater focus on prevention to reduce the numbers living in ill health.

And she added that investment in social care to support older people would also be needed: ""We know that investment in health will support our ageing population to live well with illness, as well as support economic growth.""

Stephanie Duthie and her 18-year-old daughter Bryony (right)

The family of a teenager put in a coma after developing pneumonia while on holiday in Spain have booked a £33,000 medical flight to bring her home.

Bryony Duthie, who suffers from a rare chronic kidney condition, fell ill on 16 July on the Costa Del Sol.

The 18-year-old stirred from her coma on Friday but slipped back into unconsciousness.

Doctors at Vithas Xanit International Hospital Benalmadena have so far been unable to remove her from life support.

Her family hope she can be flown from Malaga to Dundee on Thursday on an IAS Medical plane.

It will be equipped like an intensive care unit to keep her alive during the journey.

Her mother, Stephanie Duthie, 37, from Dundee, said: ""I'm just in a million pieces. We just need to get her home.

""The hospital have told us that they want her to be ventilated when she flies.

""We found a flight company who are willing to fly her home for £33,000 but it's not until next Thursday.""

Ms Duthie, who recently completed a degree in social work, said the pilot plans to fly to Dundee, their nearest airport, provided there is no rain.

If not, a longer runway at Aberdeen, Edinburgh or Glasgow will be used, although this would complicate the journey.

The family is also facing a second estimated medical bill of 27,000 euro (£23,400) for another nine days of private healthcare in Spain after already being charged more than £13,000 for her first two nights in hospital and initial treatment. The cost was not covered by their travel insurance policy.

They have set up a fundraising page which has surpassed £50,000.

The Duthie family thought Bryony, who lost her father when she was three, had become ill because of her chronic kidney problems.

But a CT scan later revealed she had pneumonia.

While doctors have been trying to cautiously bring her out of the coma, they fear she could suffer another seizure at any time.

Ms Duthie added: ""She's starting to wake up but when I say that, I mean she's opening her eyes, she's not compos mentis.

""She can't follow commands, like squeeze my finger or anything like that.

""They have now put her back into a coma. It's really horrible to watch.""

Ms Duthie is also concerned that her daughter will have to be moved to a state hospital in Spain if she cannot be flown home because the family cannot afford to keep her in private care.

She said: ""I'm scared to move her now but it's three grand a day just to be there.

""Her condition, renal tubular acidosis, is so rare and unique that it's taken them so long to get her stable.

""We just need to get her home.""

Ms Duthie thanked the public for their generosity and kind wishes.

She added: ""From the bottom of my heart, I just want to say thank you to everybody who has sent anything, from a penny to £100, to those who have shared, who have retweeted.

""We are forever indebted to these people who have donated, we could never say thank you enough.""

UK nationals have to make their own way to an airstrip near Sudanese capital Khartoum to be evacuated

This is a race against time, circumstances and numbers.

And all three are bleak. Time is ticking down to the ceasefire ending.

The circumstances are grim: unpredictable, volatile and dangerous.

And the latest numbers published by the Foreign Office make it look, on the face of it, like it will be very difficult to get every Brit out in time before the fighting resumes.

The Foreign Office have said 536 people have now been evacuated from Sudan on six UK flights as of 21:00 GMT on Wednesday evening.

Estimates as to how many British passport holders there are in Sudan vary considerably, but it is widely expected to be a few thousand at least.

And the Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, has candidly spelt out that the ceasefire ends on Thursday night and ""we cannot guarantee how many further flights will depart once the ceasefire ends"".

But, having spoken to people across government, they feel things are going as well as could be hoped. A phrase I keep hearing is the ""calibration of risk."" Rolling risk assessments of what is possible. How to help, without jeopardising the safety of the rescuers or the rescued.

It should not be a ""race to get it wrong"", as one figure put it. But being the last to get it right is not a prize anyone wants either.

You can hear the exhaustion and sleep depriv"
63,"ation in the voices of those working on this. There is talk of people sleeping on sofas in between long stints in the Foreign Office's Crisis Centre.

Sources tell me there is the capacity to increase the frequency of flights out of Khartoum, if needs be. There is also the option of taking people out by ship from Port Sudan. But the focus is on those flights, for now.

Contingency planning is under way for what to do when the ceasefire ends.

All this, as the government faces criticism from some that they have been too slow.

Some of those flown out of Sudan have expressed gratitude at being rescued in their first sentence, and criticism at its lack of pace in their second.

And there have been comparisons with how other countries have managed things.

France, for instance, collected some of its people who wanted to leave, rather than asking them to make their own way to the airfield. One of their soldiers was seriously injured in the process.

UK Special Forces were used to extract British diplomats. But the government argues it would be hugely dangerous to provide what would amount to an armed taxi service to take people to the airport, as it would risk drawing the UK into the conflict.

And the numbers of citizens it is attempting to help is far greater than other comparable countries.

Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the UK can not guarantee how many more flights will depart Sudan when the ceasefire ends

Incidentally, as my colleague, the BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill, has reported, there has been something of a spat between the German government and the UK government, with Berlin accusing London of delaying the evacuation of its own citizens by landing in Sudan without permission at the weekend.

There is private shock here that Germany went public with this and a desire not to be drawn into a diplomatic tit for tat over it. The Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are denying the allegation.

It is worth mentioning too that there is not a domestic political row here at Westminster about how the government is handling things.

Privately some Labour figures think it has been too slow. But they are not leaping to criticise ministers - perhaps conscious any critique would, by extension, be seen as undermining the armed forces, diplomats and others doing all they can in very difficult circumstances.

The political argument may, of course, change, as that race against time, circumstances and numbers continues with the prospect it gets considerably more difficult.

The film's marketing campaign has been huge - and hugely successful - with debut takings worldwide of $337m (£293m)

'Barbenheimer' fever took hold in the UK as Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's Barbie took £30m on their opening box office weekend.

According to the UK Cinema Association, that makes it the most successful weekend for UK cinema-going since 2019.

That year, Disney blockbuster Avengers: Endgame opened with takings of £43.7m.

The Vue cinema chain said this weekend marked the second biggest in its history by admissions.

Barbie is now on track to become the biggest film released so far this year, ahead of Super Mario Bros.

A more detailed breakdown of the weekend's UK box office figures will be published later on Monday.

Barbie's marketing campaign has been huge - and hugely successful - with debut takings worldwide of $337m (£293m).

US and Canada takings were enough to make it the biggest opener of 2023 so far in that region.

The film took an estimated $155m (£120m) according to distributor Warner Bros, while Oppenheimer made $93.7m (£72m), Universal Pictures said.

The North American box office figure broke the opening weekend record for a female director, easily overtaking the $103.3m opening of Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman.

Both films have been a welcome relief for cinemas who are battling against the juggernaut of streaming.

Oppenheimer's plot is centred on the development of the first atomic bomb, starring Cillian Murphy and directed by Christopher Nolan.

Barbie tells a coming-of-age story of the children's character where she explores her identity and encourages friend Ken to establish individuality.

According to Billboard, film polling service PostTrak reported that women made up 65% of the Barbie audience, while 40% of ticket-buyers were under the age of 25.

It wasn't all plain sailing for Barbie, however. In China, the world's second biggest movie market, the film opened in fifth place.

Indian cinemagoers were in for a surprise at one screening of Nolan's film Oppenheimer starring Cillian Murphy

It took just $8.2 million in its opening three days, according to data from consultancy firm Artisan Gateway, although it's not unusual for Chinese audiences to favour homegrown cinema over Hollywood and some analysts considered that hitting the $8m mark was above expectations.

Meanwhile, Indian cinemagoers were in for a surprise at one screening of Nolan's film, which was reportedly accompanied by Barbie subtitles.

""Friend of my cousin posted on insta that a cinema played Oppenheimer with Barbie subtitles,"" wrote Twitter user Sapun.

Barbie's release was delayed in Pakistan's Punjab province on Friday over ""objectionable content"", officials said.

Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan's interview with BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall is on the BBC iPlayer for 11 months.

In the Iranian capital, Tehran, protesters have taken to the streets to condemn the strike on their consulate in Damascus.

""We know that this act is done out of desperation and the regime [Israeli government] is in a serious predicament and is caught in an internal crisis and the war in Gaza,"" said demonstrator Mohammad Razavi to Reuters news agency.

""It is natural that, in line with the crisis-solving strategy, it tries to transfer the crisis from the inside to the outside to free itself a little, so this rude action can make it easier for them.

Quote Message: We must have a serious answer to this action, like the answer we gave during the assassination of General Soleimani and this answer must reach the whole world. from Mohammad Razavi We must have a serious answer to this action, like the answer we gave during the assassination of General Soleimani and this answer must reach the whole world.

Another protester, a woman called Kosar Adhami, said: ""The embassy is considered part of a country's territory. There should definitely be a firm response to this action. For us to sit quietly is not the right thing to do at all because [Israel] would dare to target more positions and may tell itself why not Tehran next time?

""Fitting revenge must be taken.""

Last updated on .From the section Leicester

Leicester City have sacked manager Brendan Rodgers after Saturday's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace, with the club's board ""compelled to take alternative action"" to stay in the Premier League.

A fifth defeat in six league games dropped them into the relegation zone.

Rodgers, appointed in February 2019, won Leicester's first FA Cup in 2021.

But chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said performances and results this season had been ""below our shared expectations"".

In a statement, he added: ""It had been our belief that continuity and stability would be key to correcting our course, particularly given our previous achievements under Brendan's management.

""Regrettably, the desired improvement has not been forthcoming and, with 10 games of the season remaining, the board is compelled to take alternative action to protect our Premier League status.

""The task ahead of us in our final 10 games is clear. We now need to come together - fans, players and staff - and show the poise, quality and fight to secure our position as a Premier League club.""

There have now been 12 managerial departures in the Premier League this season, and of the bottom nine teams in the league, only West Ham and Nottingham Forest have not made a change.

Speaking on Radio 5 Live, former Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage said: ""Brendan has"
64,"been unbelievable at Leicester. He had options to go elsewhere but stayed loyal. Results haven't been good enough, though. So is it the right thing? Inevitably the manager takes responsibility. The big question is: Do they have a plan?""The short-termism in management is remarkable. If you have an chance to move to bigger clubs but stay loyal to the club, where is the reward in that? The inevitability is you will be sacked.

""It's not a decision the board will have taken lightly. You do it with the best interests of the club at heart. If they stay up, it would be the right decision.""

'His place in Leicester history is assured'

Rodgers, 50, led Leicester to consecutive fifth-place finishes in his first two full seasons, and they also beat Chelsea to lift the FA Cup in 2021.

But his side began the 2022-23 campaign with seven defeats from their opening 10 Premier League games, slumping to the bottom of the table before a run of four wins from five games going into the World Cup break.

They have struggled since the season resumed, collecting just seven points from 33 available.

Leicester exited the Carabao Cup against Newcastle and the FA Cup against Blackburn during that run.

The Foxes rallied in January when a 2-2 draw with Brighton was followed by impressive wins over Aston Villa and Tottenham - scoring four goals in both of those victories.

But results again dipped, with the club failing to win in eight games in all competitions since the victory over Spurs on 11 February.

Rodgers won 92 of his 204 games in charge - a win percentage of 45.1%.

Srivaddhanaprabha added: ""The achievements of the team under Brendan's management speak for themselves - we've experienced some of our finest footballing moments under his guidance and will always be grateful to him and his staff for the heights they helped us to reach on the pitch.

""Off the pitch, Brendan embraced the culture of the club and helped cultivate an outstanding developmental environment, particularly during the transition to Seagrave, and provided strong leadership during the unprecedented challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. His place in Leicester City history is assured.""

Club have had to balance the books

Earlier in the season, Rodgers said Leicester was not the club ""that it was a couple of years ago"" after a frustrating summer transfer window.

Only defender Wout Faes and goalkeeper Alex Smithies were brought in during the summer, with Rodgers saying the club had to balance the books.

In January, they signed defender Harry Souttar from Stoke City, left-back Victor Kristiansen from Copenhagen and brought in winger Tete from Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk on loan.

In March, Leicester announced pre-tax losses of £92.5m for the year up to 31 May 2022 - an increase of £61.3m compared to the previous 12 months.

There have been some high-profile departures, with defender Wesley Fofana joining Chelsea for about £70m last summer and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, a key figure in their title-winning side, leaving for Nice.

Reaction - 'Panic stations among so many teams'

Former England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""No-one expected Leicester to be near the bottom three. It is a surprise. They have had problems, key players have left - Schmeichel was a massive loss.

""They have had financial problems, and have brought players in perhaps not to the standard they wanted. He's done a very good job with the players he has to work with. But a lot of teams have pressed the panic button and you can't afford to drop out of this league.""

Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports: ""He hasn't had that spark this season. Something wasn't right. I'm a big fan of Brendan and no doubt he will get back in football. Look at what Crystal Palace have done - it is panic stations among so many teams.""

Former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given on Sky Sports: ""I feel for Brendan. In the past two years, he has not been backed by the owners and that is not Brendan's problem. He got the rug pulled from under his feet. He is a top manager and will get another top job. It shows the stakes are getting higher and higher.""

What do the Pope's crazy puffa jacket, a student avoiding a parking ticket, a dry government document and Elon Musk warning the robots might come for us have in common?

This is not an April Fool's joke but a genuine question.

The answer is AI - artificial intelligence - two words we are going to hear a lot about in the coming months.

The picture of the Pope in a Michelin-man style white coat was everywhere online but was made using AI by a computer user from Chicago.

In Yorkshire, 22-year-old Millie Houlton asked AI chatbot ChatGPT to ""please help me write a letter to the council, they gave me a parking ticket"" and sent it off. The computer's version of her appeal successfully got her out of a £60 fine.

Also this week, without much fanfare, the government published draft proposals on how to regulate this emerging technology, while a letter signed by more than 1,000 tech experts including Tesla boss Elon Musk called on the world to press pause on the development of more advanced AI because it poses ""profound risks to humanity"".

You are not alone if you don't understand all the terms being bandied about:

It's the speed at which the technology is progressing that led those tech entrepreneurs to intervene, with one AI leader even writing in a US magazine this week: ""Shut it down.""

Twitter, Tesla and SpaceX mogul Elon Musk is one of those calling for a pause to the development of advanced AI

Estonian billionaire Jaan Tallinn is one of them. He was one of the brains behind internet communication app Skype but is now one of the leading voices trying to put the brakes on.

I asked him, in an interview for this Sunday's show, to explain the threat as simply as he could.

""Imagine if you substitute human civilisation with AI civilisation,"" he told me. ""Civilisation that could potentially run millions of times faster than humans... so like, imagine global warming was sped up a million times.

""One big vector of existential risk is that we are going to lose control over our environment.

""Once we have AIs that we a) cannot stop and b) are smart enough to do things like geoengineering, build their own structures, build their own AIs, then, what's going to happen to their environment, the environment that we critically need for our survival? It's up in the air.""

And if governments don't act? Mr Tallinn thinks it's possible to ""apply the existing technology, regulation, knowledge and regulatory frameworks"" to the current generation of AI, but says the ""big worry"" is letting the technology race ahead without society adapting: ""Then we are in a lot of trouble.""

It's worth noting they are not saying they want to put a stop to the lot but pause the high-end work that is training computers to be ever smarter and more like us.

The pace of change and its potential presents an almighty challenge to governments around the world.

Westminster and technology are not always a happy mix and while politics moves pretty fast these days, compared to developments in Silicon Valley, it's a snail versus an F1 car.

There are efforts to put up some guard rails in other countries. On Friday Italy banned ChatGPT while the EU is working on an Artificial Intelligence Act. China is bringing in laws and a ""reg"
65,"istry"" for algorithms - the step-by-step instructions used in programming that tell computers what to do.

But the UK government's set of draft proposals this week proposed no new laws, and no new watchdog or regulator to take it on. Even though the White Paper is an effort to manage one of the biggest technological changes in history, blink and you might have missed it.

The government wants, for now, to give existing regulators like the Health and Safety Executive the responsibility of keeping an eye on what is going on. The argument is that AI will potentially have a role in every aspect of our lives, in endless ways, so to create one new big referee is the wrong approach. One minister told me that ""it's a whole revolution"" so ""identifying it as one technology is wrong"".

Ministers also want the UK to make the most of its undoubted expertise in the field because AI is big business with huge potential benefits.

The government is reluctant to introduce tight regulation that could strangle innovation. The challenge according to the minister is to be ""very, very tough on the bad stuff"", but ""harness the seriously beneficial bits"" too.

That approach hasn't persuaded Labour's shadow digital secretary Lucy Powell, who says the government ""hasn't grappled with the scale of the problem"" and we are ""running to catch up"".

Are existing regulators really up to the task? The Health and Safety Executive wouldn't say how many staff it had ready to work on the issue or are being trained. ""We will work with the government and other regulators as AI develops and explore the challenges and opportunities it brings using our scientific expertise,"" they told me.

Should we be as worried about AI as clerics were about the printing press in the 15th Century?

How on earth can any government strike the right balance? Predictions about the potential of technology are often wildly wrong. One MP familiar with the field reckons: ""The tech bros have all watched a bit too much Terminator - how does this technology go from a computer program to removing oxygen from the atmosphere?"" The MP believes heavier regulation won't be required for a few years.

One tech firm has told us there is no need to panic: ""There are harms we're already aware of, like deep fake videos impersonating people or students cheating on tests, but that's quite a leap to then say we should all be terrified of a sentient machine taking control or killing humanity.""

Another senior MP, whose been studying the UK's proposals, says the risks are not yet ""catastrophic"" and it's better to take a careful and gradual approach to any new laws than ""take a running jump, and splash into the unknown"".

But to worry about big changes is part of human nature. Clerics worried the printing press would make monks lazy in the 15th Century. Weavers smashed up machines in the 19th Century fearing they'd lose their livelihood.

Even your author snubbed the offer of a mobile phone in 1997 convinced they'd only be for ""show-offs"" and would never really catch on.

What is certain, is that this generation of politicians and those who follow will increasingly have to spend their time grappling with this emerging frontier of technology.

A joint funeral service has taken place for brother and sister Dan and Christine McKane who died in the collision

The hearts of a community have been ""torn apart"" by the deaths of two siblings in a crash in Strabane, County Tyrone, a priest has said.

Brother and sister Christine and and Dan McKane died along with their aunt Julia McSorley, 75, in the collision on the A5 last Thursday,

The minibus they were travelling in was in a collision with a lorry.

Mourners have heard how Dan McKane was ""a big-hearted"" man who lived for his family.

Christine McKane was described as ""small in stature but big of heart"".

Fr Declan Boland told mourners in The Church of The Immaculate Conception, she was ""a pocket rocket"" whose children and grandchildren were ""everything to her"".

Brother and sister Dan and Christine McKane died in the collision

The mother-of-three was described as a ""chocoholic"" who was ""so proud of her two wonderful little grandchildren"".

""Her wonderful children and beautiful grandchildren, they were everything to Christine. She just lived for them,"" Fr Boland said.

He added: ""As long as they were all happy and okay, she was happy"".

Nothing, the parish priest said, ""was a bother to Dan McKane"". A father of two daughters, he was the ""go-to person"" in times of need.

A lorry driver for a living, Fr Boland said it was ""in his blood"".

Fr Boland said local hearts ""are sad and broken"" following the crash on Thursday.

A single piper led a procession of hundreds into The Church of The Immaculate Conception

""Events of last week remind us we are fragile. We never know the day or hour, that has been brought home so forcibly in recent days.

""Our community's hearts have been torn apart by this terrible loss"".

He thanked Commandant Brian Walsh, aide-de-camp to President Michael D Higgins, for his message of support. He also thanked Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill, who was among the mourners.

Earlier, a single piper led a procession of hundreds into the church. As the coffins entered the church grounds side-by-side, four lorries beeped their horns in unison.

Naomh Eoghan GAA formed a guard of honour outside the church, as the service took place.

Requiem Mass was held for Ms McSorley on Sunday.

She was described as ""selfless, smiling, kind and bubbly"".

Julia McSorley's funeral has taken place in Glenock, near Strabane, County Tyrone

Thursday's fatal crash was the latest to happen on the A5 road, which forms part of the main route between Londonderry and Dublin.

Four other people were injured in the incident.

Campaigners from Enough Is Enough, a group calling for urgent improvements to the route, previously said 44 people have died on the road since plans to upgrade it were first announced in 2007.

Celebrities and fans have paid tribute to Tina Turner, the soul star behind hits like The Best and What's Love Got to Do With It, who has died aged 83.

Beyoncé said she was the ""epitome of passion and power"", while Sir Mick Jagger called her a ""wonderful friend"" and ""enormously talented"" performer.

Turner was also praised by Mariah Carey and Oprah Winfrey as a ""survivor"" who overcame years of domestic abuse.

The Obamas praised her for ""singing her truth through joy and pain"".

They were joined by current US President Joe Biden, who noted that Turner had started life as a farmer's daughter and hailed her ""once-in-a-generation talent"".

Beyoncé performed with Turner at the 2008 Grammy Awards

The singer's death was announced on Wednesday by her publicist. No cause was given, but she had suffered a number of health issues in recent years, including a stroke and kidney disease.

Known as the Queen of Rock and Roll, she was a firebrand on the stage, and one of the most unforgettable vocalists of her generation.

She embarked on her singing career in the 1950s and found fame with the Ike Turner Revue, before re-emerging as a solo star in the 1980s.

US singer Gloria Gaynor said Turner ""paved the way for so many women in rock music, black and white"".

""She did with great dignity and success what very few would even have dared to do in her time and in that genre of music. ""

Another contemporary, Diana Ross, said she was ""shocked"" and ""saddened"" by Turner's death; while Dionne Warwick remembered her as an ""eternal ball of energy"".

Mick Jagger, who often collaborated with Turner, wrote on Twitter: ""I'm so saddened by the passing of my wonderful friend Tina Turner.

""She was truly an enormously talented performer and singer. She was inspiring, warm, funny and generous. She helped me so much when I was young and"
66,"I will never forget her.""

Turner and Jagger performed together at Live Aid in 1985

Sir Elton John called Turner a ""total legend on record and on stage"".

He said: ""We have lost one of the world's most exciting and electric performers... She was untouchable.""

Welsh star Dame Shirley Bassey recalled how Turner ""really gave it her everything and was a fantastic performer"", and US Government space agency Nasa added: Simply the best. Music legend Tina Turner sparkled across the stage and into millions of hearts as the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll. Her legacy will forever live among the stars.""

Born in Tennessee and raised in the church, Turner basically elbowed her way into rock 'n' roll and rose to fame in the 1960s.

When Ike Turner refused to give her an audition, she waited for the intermission in his show, grabbed a drummer's microphone and let rip.

She sang with the band for the rest of the night, and soon got equal billing with Ike - later marrying her co-star.

""When Ike heard me, he said, 'My God!'"" she told People magazine in 1981. ""He couldn't believe that voice coming out of this frail little body.""

They became one of the most watchable, combustible bands on the soul circuit; and many of their hits were covers of other people's material.

From Proud Mary to Get Back, via Whole Lotta Love, Turner made the songs her own, bringing an unforgettable rasp and a powerful female perspective to those rock and roll standards.

John Fogerty, the former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman who wrote Proud Mary, tweeted: ""So deeply sad to hear about Tina Turner's passing… I loved her version of Proud Mary! It was different and fantastic. I was also so happy because she chose my song and it was her breakthrough record.""

The star was left penniless after divorcing Ike Turner in the 1970s, but she went on to achieve even greater success as a solo artist, with hits including What's Love Got To Do With It, Let's Stay Together, The Best Steamy Windows, Private Dancer and James Bond theme GoldenEye.

A number of Wednesday night's tributes referred to her escape from her husband's abuse.

The charity Women's Aid was among those to quote one of Turner's songs, saying: ""She will always be simply the best.""

TV presenter Oprah Winfrey cited Turner's ""courage"", adding: ""Her life became a clarion call for triumph.""

In an effusive message, singer Mariah Carey called Turner not only an ""incredible performer"" but also a ""survivor and an inspiration to women everywhere"".

Tributes are being paid around the world

Beyoncé, another younger star who was influenced by Turner, wrote on her website: ""My beloved queen. I love you endlessly.

""I am so grateful for your inspiration, and all the ways you have paved the way. You are strength and resilience. You are the epitome of passion and power.

""We are all so fortunate to have witnessed your kindness and beautiful spirit that will forever remain. Thank you for all you have done.""

Singer PP Arnold - who performed alongside Turner - told the BBC that the two women's relationship had ""changed my life"" and saved her from an abusive teen marriage.

Numerous other musicians including Janelle Monáe, Dolly Parton, Blondie's Debbie Harry and Sir Tom Jones were quick to hail the late performer's achievements.

She won eight Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2021 as a solo artist, having earlier been inducted alongside Ike.

Her glittering career also saw her make film appearances; while the 1993 biopic What's Love Got To Do With It told the story of her own life.

Angela Bassett, who memorably earned an Oscar nomination for playing Turner, said the star had ""showed others who lived in fear what a beautiful future filled with love, compassion, and freedom should look like"".

In a lengthy statement to Deadline, she added: ""Her final words to me - for me - were 'You never mimicked me. Instead, you reached deep into your soul, found your inner Tina, and showed her to the world.'

""I shall hold these words close to my heart for the rest of my days. I am honoured to have known Tina Turner.""

Fans left flowers at locations including Turner's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame

Fans around the world paid their own respects - with flowers laid on Turner's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, and candles lit outside her home in Küsnacht, near Zurich.

Bouquets were left outside London's Aldwych Theatre - the current home of a musical named Tina, about the late singer's life.

The show's star Kristina Love addressed the news on stage, recalling the time she met Turner, who had made her ""feel comfortable with the mammoth task ahead in playing her"".

West End theatres announced they would dim their lights for two minutes from 19:00 BST on Thursday in her memory.

The BBC also heard reactions from members of the public outside Washington DC's National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Turner was the ""epitome of resilience and starting again"", said one woman named Marlene.

Ernest Lawrence, a T-shirt seller, said he planned to make a design with Turner on it - explaining that the performer had ""one of the most successful legacies in music in my lifetime"".

He hailed the late star as a ""great black female"" and a ""positive image for any woman"", having overcome ""hard times"" in her personal life.

At least 11 people - including a two-year-old child - have been killed in Russian shelling of Slovyansk in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.

Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said around 21 others had been wounded in the attack on a residential district of the city.

Gov Kyrylenko added that several more were missing, warning that they could be trapped beneath the rubble.

In a post to social media, President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned what he called a brutal and evil attack.

""The evil state once again demonstrates its essence,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Just killing people in broad daylight. Ruining, destroying all life.""

Officials confirmed that one of those killed was a two-year-old child. A senior adviser to Mr Zelensky said the child had been pulled alive from the rubble, but died in an ambulance while being taken to hospital.

Gov Kyrylenko said five houses and five blocks of flats were hit in the strike, while businesses and shops were also damaged in the blasts, which took place at around 18:00 local time (16:00 BST).

He added that the strike had likely been carried out using repurposed S-300 missiles. The system was originally designed as a surface-to-air defence system, but Russia has increasingly used it to strike ground targets in Ukraine as the war has progressed and Moscow's stores of munitions have been depleted.

Reporters from the AFP news agency witnessed rescue workers digging for survivors at the scene of one of the blasts, as black smoke billowed from another building across the street.

They added that the street, which included a playground, was littered with debris that included torn pages from school books and children's drawings.

Earlier, Andriy Yermak - the head of Mr Zelensky's private office - said seven explosions had been heard in the city, some of which took place near a school.

While Ukraine still controls Slovyansk, the city lies just 27 miles (45km) north-west of Bakhmut, which has been the centre of an extensive Russian assault for several months.

Russia has been trying to capture the city since last summer, and on Friday defence officials in Moscow said mercenaries from the Wagner group were continuing to attack the city.

Russian airborne troops were ""providing support to assault squads and halting the enemy's attempts to deliver ammunition to the city and bring in reserves,"" the statement added.

Ukraine insists that it will continue to defend Bakhmut, which military"
67,"analysists say has limited strategic value. But Russia is believed to have suffered extremely high casualties trying to capture the city.

An analysis of open sources conducted by the BBC's Russian service established the identities of at least 20,451 Russian soldiers killed since the war began. Some 1,820 of those deaths came in the last two weeks, the analysis found.

Sacha Baron Cohen is planning to revive Ali G, the infamous spoof wannabe gangster who became a comedy star 25 years ago, for a new stand-up tour.

Ali G became a hit thanks to his prank interviews with unsuspecting experts on his TV show in the early 2000s.

He then starred in his own film, and has made occasional appearances in recent years.

Variety reported that Baron Cohen has been working on a stand-up tour in which Ali G will feature.

BBC News has confirmed the report, but there are no further details of the tour.

In 2021, Baron Cohen brought back Ali G for a sketch at the MTV Movie & TV Awards, and for a one-off routine at a Sydney comedy club.

""I just wanted to get on stage and muck around and see what Ali G would be like with a crowd,"" the comedian told GQ afterwards. ""It was really good fun.""

In the early days, Ali G got laughs by duping an array of interviewees into going along with his persona, while also lampooning white people from the suburbs who posed as the urban youth.

But the act was criticised by some, who saw it as adopting and ridiculing black street culture.

Baron Cohen, now 51, also found success by playing similar pranks as his Kazakh reporter Borat, and played flamboyant Austrian fashionista Bruno.

Samantha Mulcahy (left) and Kimberley Sampson died weeks apart after being operated on by the same surgeon

The mother of a young woman who died with herpes said she was ""disgusted"" with an NHS trust which ""lied"" about the potential cause of the virus.

Kim Sampson and Samantha Mulcahy died with herpes after the same obstetrician at the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Trust carried out their Caesareans.

Yvette Sampson's daughter had been ""fit and healthy"" until she gave birth on 3 May 2018, an inquest has heard.

She said the trust had lied about links between the two mothers' deaths.

They were treated by the same surgeon and midwife six weeks apart, neither of whom were tested for herpes, the inquest in Maidstone was told.

Ms Sampson said her daughter had been ""in agony"" from 3 May when she gave birth to her second child, until she died on 22 May.

She told the inquest she had received ""poor treatment"" by midwives at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital (QEQM) in Margate, which she felt also ""contributed"" to her daughter's death.

Ms Sampson was initially denied a Caesarean and instead told to push for almost three hours, despite repeatedly telling midwives that ""something wasn't right"" and ""clinging to the bed in agony"", her mother said.

One midwife refused to transfer her to surgeons, who later admitted that she should have had the operation sooner, she said.

Ms Sampson lost almost four pints of blood after the baby's position meant an artery was torn.

""I could not understand why no-one was listening to Kim or acting on her concerns when she said something wasn't right. The midwives didn't seem to take notice of her pain.""

In the following days, Ms Sampson was unable to walk, and her stomach had not deflated, but two midwives who visited their home said they had ""no concerns"", her mother said.

It was not until 10 May that she was taken to A&E at the QEQM and treated for sepsis.

After four operations to drain fluid from her abdomen, surgeons told the family that ""Kim's liver was black and she was unlikely to live"".

In July 2018, first-time mother Mrs Mulcahy died from an infection caused by the same virus at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford.

Ms Sampson said the trust had ""lied"" to the family about a known link between her daughter's death and Ms Mulcahy's following an investigation.

She said emails from the East Kent trust to Public Health England exposed how they had never tested the surgeon and midwife common to both cases for herpes.

""I am disgusted with the trust and how our family has been treated,"" she said.

In March, the Mid Kent and Medway Coroner, Catherine Wood, accepted an application from the trust to give anonymity to the surgeon common to both cases.

Rasmus Paludan had threatened to burn a copy of the Quran in Wakefield

A Danish far-right politician has been barred from the UK after threatening to burn a copy of the Quran in Wakefield.

Security minister Tom Tugendhat said Rasmus Paludan, founder of the anti-Islam party Stram Kurs, had been added to the UK's immigration watchlist.

Mr Paludan had said he planned to burn the religious text in a public square in the West Yorkshire city this week.

It comes after four pupils at a Wakefield school were suspended over damage to a copy of the Quran.

In a video posted to Twitter on Sunday, Mr Paludan said he would travel to the city to ""fight back"" against ""undemocratic forces"".

He claimed he intended to burn the Quran on Wednesday to coincide with the start of Ramadan.

Mr Paludan has held several previous protests in which the Islamic text was burned, with some leading to violent counter-demonstrations.

In January he burned a copy of the Quran outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm.

That protest became part of a diplomatic row between Turkey and Sweden - with Turkey now holding up Sweden's application to join Nato.

The security minister told the House of Commons about his intervention after Simon Lightwood, the Labour MP for Wakefield, raised concerns on Monday about Mr Paludan's potential visit.

Mr Lightwood said: ""Far-right Islamophic Danish politician Rasmus Paludan said he is going to travel from Denmark to Wakefield for the sole purpose of burning a Quran in a public place.

""Mr Paludan was previously jailed in Denmark for his hateful and racist statements. He is a dangerous man that should not be allowed into this country.

""Can the home secretary assure me and my community that the government is taking action to prevent this?""

Mr Tugendhat said Mr Paludan had been added to to the UK's warnings index.

He added: ""His travel to the United Kingdom would not be conducive with the public good and he will not be allowed access.""

Four pupils were suspended from Wakefield's Kettlethorpe High School in February after a Year 10 student brought in a Quran, reportedly as part of a dare.

The cover of the Islamic text had been torn and some pages scuffed, but police concluded no offences were committed and the school's headteacher said she was satisfied there was ""no malicious intent by those involved"".

Suella Braverman says she is ""confident nothing untoward happened"", but has refused to be drawn over whether she asked civil servants to arrange a one-to-one speed awareness course for her.

The home secretary was caught speeding in 2022 and, according to reports, asked the civil service for advice on arranging a private course.

The PM is under pressure to investigate whether she broke the ministerial code.

Rishi Sunak has asked his ethics adviser about the case.

He has also spoken to the home secretary, and Downing Street said he still had confidence in the home secretary.

Mrs Braverman is under scrutiny not over the speeding offence itself,"
68,"but over whether she acted properly in relation to the civil service, by asking officials to assist with a private matter, over a one-to-one speed awareness course.

After being caught speeding, Ms Braverman faced getting three points on her licence and a fine, or a course as part of a group.

A government source told the BBC the senior minister had been ""concerned"" about her insurance premiums, and favoured doing a course. She is reported to have asked civil servants about a one-on-one course, citing security concerns about doing one as part of a group. She was told it was not a matter for the civil service.

She then asked a special adviser to try to arrange a private course.

When the speed course provider said there was no option to do this, Mrs Braverman opted to pay the fine and accept the points, because she was ""very busy"" a source told the BBC. By this point she had been reappointed as home secretary in Mr Sunak's government.

The same government source refused to say whether Mrs Braverman's motivation to do the course in private was to reduce the chances of her being recognised by members of the public.

Speeding awareness course providers are contracted by individual police forces. According to UK Road Offender Education, the not-for-profit organisation responsible, these contracts make ""no provision for private one-to-one courses"" at the request of the driver.

The ministerial code requires ministers to ensure ""no conflict arises"" between their public duties and their private interests.

Repeatedly asked in an interview whether she instructed officials to arrange a one-on-one speeding course, Mrs Braverman said: ""Last summer, I was speeding, I regret that, I paid the fine and I took the points.""

Asked whether she would welcome an investigation into what happened or if she had spoken to the prime minister about it, Ms Braverman said: ""I am focussed on working as the home secretary.""

Speaking to the Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4, former senior civil servant Sir Philip Rycroft said Mrs Braverman's reported actions appeared to be a ""real lapse of judgement"".

""Obviously, there's still investigations to be done and so on but the code is very clear. Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises or appears to arise between their public duties and their private interests.

""Even asking a question of a civil servant as to how she might go on one of these courses puts them in an impossible position.""

The ministerial code sets standards of conduct expected of ministers, including that they must uphold the political impartiality of the civil service.

Former business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told Radio 4's World at One, he was confident Ms Braverman had not broken any rules.

""What goes on in private offices is a minister is busy and has many things to do and sometimes will ask for something the civil servants can't do,"" he said.

""As soon as once they say no, and you accept it, you haven't done anything wrong.""

In the Commons, Mr Sunak told MPs he has ""asked for further information"" and will update MPs ""on the appropriate course of action in due course"".

The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Sunak ""wants to avail himself of all the information before he makes a decision"". The prime minister still has confidence in the home secretary, the spokesman added.

Mrs Braverman was in Downing Street on Monday lunchtime, and afterwards headed to the House of Commons for a scheduled question session from MPs on Home Office issues.

During the session, Mrs Braverman was repeatedly pressed on whether she had asked civil servants to arrange a private speed awareness course.

Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""If the home secretary can't grip on her own rule-breaking behaviour how can she get a grip on anything else.""

The home secretary told MPs she had paid the speeding fine and had not sought to avoid any sanction.

Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should order his adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate whether ministerial rules were broken.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir said it looked like ""inappropriate action took place"" from the home secretary that ""needs to be fully investigated"".

""The usual consequence of breaking the ministerial code is that you'll go,"" he added.

The Liberal Democrats are also calling for an investigation and said Mr Sunak needed to make a statement in Parliament about the claims.

Answering questions at the G7 summit over the weekend, Mr Sunak apparently did not know anything about the story the until it was first reported in the Sunday Times. and he declined to say whether he would be ordering an investigation.

Speaking at a news conference, he also declined to say he backed Mrs Braverman - but a Downing Street source later said that ""of course"" he did.

After serving as attorney general between February 2020 and September 2022, Mrs Braverman was promoted to home secretary under Liz Truss.

She resigned on 19 October after sending an official document from a personal email to a backbench MP - describing it as a ""technical infringement of the rules"". But she was reappointed to the same role by Mr Sunak six days later following the collapse of Liz Truss's government.

The whales stranded on Lewis will be moved to a landfill in Stornoway for post-mortem examinations

Scientists are carrying out a ""monumental"" post-mortem investigation on a pod of 55 whales that became stranded in the Western Isles.

Only 15 were alive after they washed on to Traigh Mhor beach at North Tolsta on the Isle of Lewis on Sunday morning.

One is believed to have been successfully refloated, but the rest were euthanised on welfare grounds.

It is the highest number of deaths following a mass stranding of animals in the UK for at least 70 years.

Leading veterinary pathologist Dr Andrew Brownlow said the investigation would be a ""monumental task"".

He is director of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS), whose team will carry out the post-mortem examinations.

Attempts were made to give surviving whales first aid on Sunday

They will gather data from a select number of the whales as they would be unable to examine all 55.

Weather could also impede the process though Dr Brownlow said conditions had improved since Sunday.

He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""It's going to be a monumental task.

""There are more animals sadly which are awaiting necropsy now than all of the mass strandings put together for the last decade.

""What we will try and do is triage these animals - we will select those animals that we think best represent the rest of the pod and make sure that we take samples and as much data that we can.

""Then it's simply a race against time, energy and weather. We will do the most that we possibly can to find out what's been going on here.""

Pilot whales are known for their strong social bonds, so often when one whale gets into difficulty and strands, the rest follow.

Between 60-70 of the animals came into shallow waters in Sutherland in 2011 while 21 died during a stranding at Pittenweem in 2012.

According to the Natural History Museum, the largest UK stranding took place in 1927 when 126 out of more than 130 false killer whales died in the Dornoch Firth in the Highlands.

There are also accounts of a mass stranding of pilot whales at Dunbar, East Lothian, in May 1950 with some reports saying 147 were found on the beach.

Marine charity British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said the pod on Lewis could have followed a female on to the beach when she became unwell while giving birth - as happened at Staffin on Skye in 2015.

However Dr Brownlow said there are a number of reasons behind strandings and his team will be looking to rule"
69,"out human impact.

He said: ""Pilot whale strandings have happened for centuries - it's not necessarily the case that it's because of human impact.

""But that's one of the things we want to try and investigate and rule out - to see whether or not some of the things that can affect these animals such as underwater noise, interaction with fishing gear, accumulation of toxins or disease may have played a part.""

On Sunday attempts were made to give the surviving whales first aid.

BDMLR attempted to refloat two of the more active whales - one successfully got away but another was later found further down the beach.

The whales are now being moved to a landfill in Stornoway where they will be buried after investigations take place.

Dr Brownlow said whales can be left to decompose on beaches as they form part of the natural nutrient cycle - but it the decision to move them was ""understandable"" as Traigh Mhor is one of the more popular beaches on the island.

Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - has asked people to avoid the area as the operation to remove the whales takes place.

Last year more than 200 of the same species of whales were found stranded on a remote beach on the west coast of Tasmania, Australia.

Dr Brownlow said although 55 whales was a large stranding for Scotland, it was ""not unprecedented"" - but had nevertheless attracted interest from scientists around the world.

""Although this is pretty grim and a relatively challenging thing to do, you can actually learn a lot from these animals,"" he said.

""There is interest from all over the world - we've been contacted from the guys in Tasmania who have offered us support and best wishes but are also very interested to know what we find out.

""From the process of examining these animals we can learn a lot about the threats and pressures that affect not just the animals in our waters but globally. So I think there is some value in doing this.""

Angus Cloud, who starred on HBO hit series Euphoria has died, aged 25.

Cloud, who played drug dealer Fezco ""Fez"" O'Neill on the teen drama, died on Monday at his family home in Oakland, California, said a publicist.

""It is with the heaviest heart that we had to say goodbye to an incredible human today,"" said a statement from Cloud's family.

Cloud buried his father last week, according to family, and was in a ""battle with mental health"".

""The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend,"" the statement read.

""We hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence.""

The cause of death has not been given.

""We are incredibly saddened to learn of the passing of Angus Cloud. He was immensely talented and a beloved part of the HBO and Euphoria family,"" HBO said in a statement.

""We extend our deepest condolences to his friends and family during this difficult time.""

Cloud had minor acting credits in two films, North Hollywood and The Line. He had also appeared in music videos for artists including Becky G, Karol G and Juice WRLD.

But his career really took off after he won the part of Fez, a high school drug dealer in Euphoria.

The role turned Cloud into a breakout star, according to the Hollywood Reporter, and his character was expanded in the second season.

According to a 2019 interview with GQ, Cloud had no real aspirations to become a star, or even an actor.

He used to work at a chicken and waffle joint, according to the magazine, and one day was unexpectedly stopped by an agent from a casting company.

""I was confused and I didn't want to give her my phone number,"" Cloud told GQ. ""I thought it was a scam.""

After first airing in June 2019, Euphoria quickly became a hit and by 2022 was the most tweeted-about TV show of the decade in the US.

The main character, played by Zendaya, is a 17-year-old who struggles with drug abuse, seen on screen taking the deadly opioid fentanyl and injecting morphine.

In 2022, Cloud defended accusations during an interview with TMZ that the show glorified drug use.

His Euphoria co-star, Javon ""Wanna"" Walton, known in the show as Cloud's adoptive brother, Ashtray, wrote on Instagram about Cloud's death: ""Rest easy brother.""

On X, formerly known as Twitter, California congresswoman Barbara Lee lamented the loss of ""Oakland's own"".

""His immense talent touched the lives of countless people. His work & legacy will forever live on and make Oakland proud,"" she posted.

The King and Queen met eight-year-olds Camilla Nowawakowska and Charles Murray outside St Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh

The King and Queen met another Charles and Camilla as they concluded their two-day visit to Northern Ireland in counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The royal couple greeted primary school children who had been waiting outside St Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh.

Among them was Camilla Nowawakowska, wearing a crepe-paper replica of her own crown.

Standing next to Camilla was Charles Murray, who was sporting a purple paper crown decorated with shiny stickers.

When the two children told the Queen their first names, she said: ""Goodness me, isn't that funny.

""You've got very smart crowns on, they're a little bit lighter than the one I had on.

""They look pretty cool with all the jewels.""

Charles was then called over and shook hands with the two children.

The royal couple, who have since left Northern Ireland, had just met the main Christian denominations at the Anglican St Patrick's Cathedral.

Queen Camilla also met children at Armagh Robinson Library as part of her campaign to encourage reading.

Later, they met local community groups many of whom had taken part in the Coronation Big Help Out.

Among those to give readings at the cathedral service were Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland Rev John McDowell and Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland Rev Eamon Martin.

The other denominations represented at the service were the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church.

At the library, the Queen viewed Jonathan Swift's own, annotated, copy of his book Gulliver's Travels, during her visit to the library.

Children from Drelincourt primary school, volunteers from the library and representatives from Dementia NI, all of whom use the library regularly, were among those meeting the Queen.

She said they were lucky to have access to the historical books in the library.

The royal couple then made their way to Market Theatre Square to see a celebration of culture.

The Queen got up close with the legendary characters associated with Armagh

Ulster-Scots, Irish, Chinese and South Asian cultures featured their traditional music, song and dance.

The King and Queen also met characters representing legendary and historical characters associated with Armagh, sampled local delicacies and met artisanal food producers, as well as speaking to the crowds gathered.

As the couple joined the Lord Mayor of Armagh Paul Greenfield on stage, King Charles addressed the crowd and thanked the community for its hospitality.

""I did just want to say before we leave that it's been the greatest pleasure to join you here today,"" he said.

""I realise it was 23 years ago since I was last here, and I think opened The Market Place building, which I'm so pleased to see is still going strong and I hope making a huge difference to Armagh.

""But if I may say so it's been particularly special to meet so many of you today, also a large number of school children whose exams, I suspect, we have totally disrupted.""

In the afternoon, the pair made their way to Enniskillen Castle where they met representatives from across the community, voluntary and heritage sectors in Fermanagh in celebration of the Coronation.

All smiles as the King greets schoolchildren at Enniskillen Castle

They were entertained by a special joint performance of Irish and Scottish dancers accompanied by traditional musicians.

The King and Queen were presented with a Coronation Basket made by Belleek Pottery.

Around a thousand people who had gathered outside the castle were rewarded by a royal walkabout with the King and Queen spending time shaking hands and talking to the crowd.

The King and Queen also went to Lough Erne's waterfront where they met representatives of the RNLI who marked their 200th anniversary.

A 10m humpback whale has been rescued after becoming entangled in a shark net off Australia’s Gold Coast. Workers used delicate equipment to cut the whale free during the early morning operation. Environmental groups have pushed for the removal of nets during the whale migration season, which sees tens of thousands of the mammals pass Australia’s east coast.

Kyogo Furuhashi doesn't need to don the cloak and scythe of the grim reaper when he fetches up at Ibrox on Sunday. The bare numbers of his story versus Rangers reveal how much of a bogey man he's been to the Ibrox club.

In the December meeting at Celtic Park, Kyogo had two shots on target and scored with one of them, which turned out to be the decisive goal.

In September at Ibrox, he had just nine touches of the ball in 76 minutes, one of them being the match-winner.

Last April, in a 3-2 win, he had two shots on target and two goals from only 17 touches.

A few months earlier, just when it looked like Rangers were going to win 2-1 at Ibrox, Kyogo poked in the equaliser with two minutes left. It was his only attempt on target. He had 15 touches and was largely anonymous, until he wasn't.

This time last year he was on 26 goals. Now he's on 16.
• None Rodgers has no issue with 'top referee' Beaton
• None What do the numbers tell us about derby?

He's had those Old Firm highs, but it's not been a vintage season for Kyogo. He's missed the service of Jota on one side and Liel Abada on the other, the holy trinity of the Ange Postecoglou years.

He's playing deeper under Rodgers and has suffered from the musical chairs on either side of him, the constant changing of the wide players and the lack of fluency it has brought at times. Some of that has been down to injury.

He'll still occupy the every waking thought of the Rangers defence in the build-up to Sunday.

They all know about his stealth, they've all been burned by his capacity to appear under the thumb for large parts of a game before, metaphorically, breaking free and thumping them in the face. In Kyogo, Celtic will continue to trust.

If Kyogo has inflicted pain on Rangers, then Brendan Rodgers has really been torturer-in-chief.

Fifteen games with 12 victories and only one defeat. A 4-0, a 5-0 and a 5-1. A total of 34 goals scored and only eight conceded. 1,350 minutes played and behind for only 108 of those. Eight clean sheets to Rangers' two.

Even when his team have looked shaky, they've still done the job.

Going into the first meeting of the season, Celtic had drawn with St Johnstone and had lost to Kilmarnock in their previous two games. Rangers smelt blood at Ibrox that day. Celtic won 1-0.

Earlier in December, they lost to Kilmarnock and Hearts before facing Rangers. Philippe Clement's side had gone unbeaten in 16 matches, winning 13, one of which was away to Real Betis in the Europa League. A Betis team who five days before had drawn 1-1 with the Real Madrid of Jude Bellingham, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Federico Valverde.

'It wasn't supposed to be like this for prodigal son'

Rodgers' dominance has entered the history books. With an 80% win rate, he has the highest win return of any Old Firm manager in major competitions.

Doubt from the outside world accompanied all the way to kick-off in both of his games against Rangers this season but Rodgers - and Kyogo - came up with the solutions. But there's doubt again now.

This season has not been the Celtic procession that some might have thought it was going to be. Rangers have got their act together while Celtic have bobbed along on choppy waters.

A poor summer transfer window followed by a poor January transfer window. The sound of booing at Celtic Park. The sound of Rodgers having a go at those booing. The endless grief with the Green Brigade. The ""good girl"" saga that saw Rodgers slammed by a women's campaigning group. The Scottish FA charge - and subsequent touchline ban - for accusing officials of incompetence.

It's been a grind. Five draws and three defeats. Ninetieth-minute wins against Hibs and Motherwell twice. It wasn't supposed to be like this for the prodigal son.

And yet, they're still top of the league, albeit with Rangers having a game in hand.

They've scored more goals than their city rivals, have a higher expected goals count and have created more big chances.

They've not been fluent nearly as often as Rodgers would have liked - he's had some harsh words to say about their negativity and their lack of speed of thought and movement along the way - but they're still there.

And if they win, or even draw, on Sunday you'd make them favourites to win the title because they'll have Rangers at Celtic Park post-split, a Celtic Park that will be heaving to the sound of 60,000 fans getting on the backs of visiting players, many of whom have never closed a deal as big as this one.

Rangers will be encouraged by Callum McGregor's absence since the end of February and hopeful that, even if he is ready to play, then he won't be at his totemic best.

For Rodgers, it's bigger this time. He has never faced this kind of game in Scotland before, a game that if lost could - and most probably would - cost him the title.

That's alien territory for the Celtic manager. In his previous incarnation they'd have been organising the party by now.

It's what makes Sunday so intoxicating. Rodgers, and how he will be viewed by Celtic fans in victory or in defeat, is a drama unto itself. Given their complicated feelings about him, it's a love-in or a pile-on balanced on a knife edge.

All 15 of his Old Firm games have been important, but this one holds more peril than any of the others.

The co-founder and guitarist of Irish rock band The Script, Mark Sheehan, has died.

The 46-year-old died in hospital on Friday following a brief"
71,"illness, the band announced.

Sheehan formed the group in 2001 alongside vocalist Danny O'Donoghue and drummer Glen Power.

A statement on the band's social media pages said Sheehan was a ""much loved husband, father, brother, band mate and friend"".

It asked fans to respect the privacy of his family and bandmates.

Ireland's president Michael D Higgins said Sheehan was an ""outstanding"" example of Irish musical success on the world stage.

""It was a mark of the originality and excellence that Mark and his bandmates in The Script sought that they saw such success across the world, including six number one albums in the UK and a number three album in the United States - a truly remarkable achievement,"" he said.

Contemporaries of Sheehan's in the entertainment industry were quick to honour his memory.

In a statement posted on Instagram, Irish presenter Laura Whitmore wrote: ""Thinking of you all at this time.

""Mark was one of the nicest and most talented men you could meet.""

Fellow Irish rock band Kodaline have also paid tribute, posting on Twitter: ""So sorry to hear (of) the passing of Mark Sheehan.""

In an Instagram tribute, Irish pop duo Jedward said: ""Everyone in the Irish music industry and worldwide mourn your loss RIP Mark such a talented musician from The Script one of the most iconic Irish groups of our generation.""

Fellow musicians and celebrities have come forward to pay tribute to Mark Sheehan

Sheehan was born on 29 October 1976 in Dublin in Mount Brown in The Liberties area, and was married to Reena Sheehan with whom he had three children.

He was a singer, songwriter and guitarist, and passionate about music from a young age.

From 1996-2001 he was a member of the band Mytown, alongside The Script's frontman O'Donoghue.

The Script started in Dublin in 2001 with Sheehan as guitarist, O'Donoghue as singer songwriter and Power as drummer.

The band moved to London after signing a record contract with Sony Music Group.

It was there that they released their first full album, ""We Cry"", which went on to reach number one in both Ireland and the UK.

After that their next three albums Science & Faith, #3 and No Sound Without Silence, all topped the album charts in both countries.

Science & Faith reached number three in the United States and number two in Australia.

Since then the band have continued to tour the world and release original music albums, combining Irish themes with pop-rock nuances.

They have been known for their writing from the heart, including ""If You Could See Me Now"", addressing the death of vocalist O'Donoghue's father and both of Sheehan's parents.

Fans over the last year have wondered why Sheehan had a short break from the stage.

In 2022, Sheehan missed the US leg of the band's tour. O'Donoghue told the media that his bandmate had taken a break to spend time with his family.

He explained to Sunday World that the group were supportive of Sheehan's decision and described them as a ""a band of brothers"" who ""stick together no matter what"".

In 2013, The Script had a brush with royalty, when the Queen visited the BBC's Broadcasting House and watched a performance by The Script, briefly chatting with singer O'Donoghue.

Sheehan said when he was told about the royal engagement, he thought ""people were playing a joke on us"".

The Script are scheduled to support the American artist P!nk during her European tour later this year.

British Airways is cancelling around 32 flights a day to and from Heathrow Airport at the start of the Easter holidays.

The move is due to a planned 10-day strike by 1,400 Heathrow security workers in the Unite union, who are taking action in a dispute over pay.

BA said it had offered a range of options to affected customers.

Heathrow says contingency plans will be put in place to ensure it can ""operate as normal"".

Workers at Terminal 5, which is used by British Airways, will take part in the action, as will those who check cargo.

The walkout is due to start on 31 March and end on 9 April. Talks last week failed to avert the action.

BA has been told by the airport to reduce its schedule on those days by 5% and has stopped selling tickets.

In a statement, the airline said: ""We've regrettably had to make a small number of adjustments to our schedule.

""We've apologised to customers whose travel plans have been affected and have offered them a range of options, including rebooking onto a new flight with us or another airline, or requesting a full refund.""

A Heathrow spokesperson said: ""We will not let these unnecessary strikes impact the hard-earned holidays of our passengers.""

The airport said it was deploying 1,000 additional staff, together with its management team, who will be in the terminals providing assistance to passengers over the Easter break.

It said it may take ""a little longer than usual to get through security"", and advised passengers to help ensure a smooth departure by checking their flight status before travelling to the airport, and by having their liquids and electronics ready for security.

Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, said ""our members are simply unable to make ends meet due to the low wages paid by Heathrow. They are being forced to take strike action due to need not greed.""

Heathrow says it has offered a 10% pay rise.

Strike action in other countries, notably France, has already caused a number of airlines to cancel flights this year.

Monday's strike in Germany has also caused cancellations.

Fellow Welshman Barry John (left) playing for the Lions with JPR Williams (right) against New Zealand in 1971

Wales rugby legend JPR Williams has called on the sport's chiefs to pay more attention to the links between concussion and the impact on players.

The 1970s star and surgeon spoke as researchers found a link between repeat rugby concussions and reduced blood and oxygen flow to the brain in later life.

The study said it may show why memory, thought processes and co-ordination declined in some ex-players tested.

World Rugby has said it welcomes new research into players' welfare.

Williams, a British and Irish Lion renowned for his toughness on the field in the Welsh game's 1970s golden era, said governing bodies must take more notice of research.

""There is no doubt the generations after us are going to be left worse off than we"
72,"were,"" said Williams, 74.

Commenting on the findings of the study, in which he was involved, he said: ""I'm not pleased, but it backs up what we felt was the problem.""

A separate legal case is ongoing where former players are suing the WRU, RFU and World Rugby, previously known as the International Rugby Board.

The players say they sustained permanent brain injuries in the game.

JPR Williams says the research ""backs up what we felt was the problem""

The case will be decided by a judge based on the evidence presented in court.

Thomas Owens, co-lead investigator on the University of South Wales (USW) study, said research found that retired players with a history of concussion had mild cognitive impairment.

""This is a state whereby the cognitive function of these individuals, in term of the way someone thinks, remembers information, processes that information and co-ordinates the body's movements declines over time, and particularly throughout ageing"".

He said this put them at ""increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases later in life"".

But the researchers said not everyone who played contact sports would go on to develop cognitive decline.

Williams said he had no concerns for his health but his generation was worried about neurodegenerative diseases.

Former Bridgend captain Meredydd James has undergone tests as part of the research

He is particularly concerned about the generations that came after him, especially given the intensity of the game now.

Williams said: ""I had been an orthopaedic surgeon for 35 years. I thought it was good to get involved because of the concern about lots of sports having problems with concussion"".

He cited ""serious worries, particularly with the laws of the game now, where they stand right on top of each other"".

""There seems to be a bit of a conflict between the laws, and the early onset of cognitive degeneration,"" he said.

He said cognitive health was not really known about when he played, but much less time was spent training.

""The game was amateur, we only probably had physical contact once a week. Now they have it every day, the brain needs time to recover, it's like any organ in the body, it is quite a worry, it's repetitive, not even huge bangs but repetitive small injuries to the brain can be a problem in later life.""

The 55-cap full-back wants the game to return to how it was in the 1970s, with more space for players, ""to decrease the ferocity of the hits"". He also wants reduced tackling and contact in training.

He urged governing bodies ""to take more notice than they do"" of studies such as this.

Williams reflected on an infamous moment of his career when he was stamped on by New Zealand prop John Ashworth while playing for Bridgend against the All Blacks in 1978.

Knowing what he knows now, he probably would not have returned to the field after having his face stitched up by his father at the side of the pitch.

Scientists at USW's neurovascular research laboratory analysed the brain health of 20 retired players aged between 60 and 80 who had suffered concussions.

For the first time, researchers found they had reduced blood and oxygen flow to the brain due to less nitric oxide, which helps blood vessels regulate blood around the body.

Some exhibited signs of mild cognitive impairment and all were outperformed by the control group in cognitive function tests.

The researchers said this was the first study to determine mechanisms that may cause cognitive decline and has implications for other contact sports.

It is hoped the research may contribute to improving protection for players and help with the introduction of pitch-side blood or saliva tests for concussion.

Mr Owens said: ""It's important to note that we don't want to stop players playing rugby, but we want to make them inherently aware of the risks associated with forms of brain trauma and concussion.

""Make them aware, improve the way that we detect concussion at the pitchside and then improve the way we care for players following retirement.""

Former Bridgend RFC captain Meredydd James also took part in the study, and said there was no knowledge about the dangers of concussion in his era, but he started to feel the effects later in life.

""Initially you have some aches and pains, I used to have a bit of back trouble,"" he said.

""I think for the first 20, 30 years you just go along with it and you can't say it was definitely related to rugby.

""But I think when you get to 55-plus, a little bit of memory loss, perhaps the recall, perhaps balance, those are some things starting to kick in, and you think: 'Concussion, dementia could it be something like that'?""

There are other studies taking place investigating the health of former players. Lifestyle changes, including poor diet, alcohol dependency and lack of exercise may also accelerate the cognitive decline of former athletes.

USW researchers said they recognised this study had limitations in the relatively small sample size and it relies on participants remembering past concussions.

But they are aiming to carry out a larger study and investigate the potential differences in brain health between male and female athletes in contact sports.

World Rugby previously said it ""welcomes all research that can inform and support our recently launched strategy to cement rugby as the most progressive sport on player welfare"" and undertook ""a wide-ranging evaluation of contact training"".

In 2021 it said: ""It is at the heart of everything that we say and do as a sport. World Rugby recently committed to double our investment in player welfare and new concussion research and initiatives.""

The WRU has been asked to comment.

A ban on fees to get rid of DIY waste in England will push up costs for all households, councils have warned.

Currently around a third of local authorities charge to dispose of DIY waste at recycling centres.

The government said the ban, which is expected to come into force later this year, aims to deter fly-tipping.

But the Local Government Association (LGA) said the costs would still be passed on, for example through higher council tax.

The organisation, which represents councils in England, said the change would cost many councils more than £1m a year.

Suffolk County Council said scrapping the charges would cost an estimated £500,000 a year, while Norfolk County Council said the cost would be more than £1m a year.

Charges to dispose of materials like paving slabs, plasterboard and bricks can be up to £10 an item.

The LGA's environment spokesman, Darren Rodwell, said: ""Where councils are no longer able to charge for DIY waste at recycling centres the cost will be passed to all householders, including households that do not have a car and those with no possibility of carrying out building works, for example people living in rented accommodation.""

He added: ""Manufacturers should also contribute to the costs to councils of clear up, by providing more take-back services so people can hand in sofas, old furniture and mattresses when they buy new ones.""

The government said the change was part of its wider action to tackle fly-tipping, which costs the economy an estimated £924m a year in England.

However, Mr Rodwell said evidence from councils and recycling campaign group Wrap did not show a link between charges and fly-tipping.

Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: ""We want to make it as easy as possible for people to dispose of their waste properly and that's why we are removing the financial burden on doing the right thing with DIY trash.""

Jacob Hayler, executive director of the Environmental Services Association, which represents the waste management industry, said: ""We welcome any measures that make it easier for householders to dispose of waste correctly and responsibly at their local Household Waste Recycling Centre, which in turn reduces the chance of it falling into the hands of criminals or being fly-tipped.""

In 2015, the government banned charges on local residents disposing of household rubbish at household waste centres.

Guidance made clear this includes DIY household waste. But some local authorities were still able to charge for certain types of DIY material, under rules designed for construction waste.

University of Edinburgh student Romy Ulvestad died at her parents' London home four days after her 21st birthday.

She had killed herself after staff failed to provide additional support, despite repeated warnings that she was struggling with her mental health.

Now her mother is adding her support to a campaign for the UK government to create legal duty of care for students.

The university, which apologised for failing Romy, said it had improved the support it offers since her death.

Libby Kitson, Romy's mother, has joined calls for Westminster to change the law to better protect students, and hopes the Scottish government will follow suit.

The petition to the UK government is being supported by 25 bereaved families, who have come together and set up The LEARN Network.

It reached more than 127,000 signatures before the deadline at midnight on Mothers' Day, meaning Parliament will consider the subject for debate.

Speaking to BBC Scotland, Ms Kitson said she did not know that her daughter was struggling with her mental health when she returned to London during the Covid lockdown in 2020.

""Her father and I had no idea about her mental health struggles but they had been well-flagged to people at the University of Edinburgh who could have done something about it,"" she said.

""I sent Romy to off to university to study classics, which would be a pivotal point for the rest of her life. What I didn't expect to do was send her off to university to die.""

Romy, a classics student and part-time model, died in April 2020, more than a year after she communicated with the university about her struggles by requesting a ""special circumstances"" application to resit her exams without penalty.

Ms Kitson said: ""We want there to be a legal duty of care within all higher education institutions, and I think some people, including our government, seem to think there is some legal requirement in place but there really isn't.

""You want to know that if your child is suffering with any kind of mental health issues, or is overwhelmed by university life, there are people there who are trained and skilled to help deal with it.

""And if they really, really are in a state of crisis you would want to be informed.""

Libby Kitson hopes the Scottish government will legislate after the UK government

Campaigners from ForThe100 want a change in law to ensure higher education institutions have a legal duty of care towards their students, as schools already do.

The Department of Education has said creating a legally enforced duty of care ""would be a disproportionate response"".

Ms Kitson said the campaign was not looking to provide a means for families to sue universities, but to prevent similar deaths.

She said she did not want any other parent to have to go through the same situation.

""We would hope that the Scottish Parliament would look at England and Wales and think 'they've led by example, we should follow suit',"" she said.

""A Scottish student's life is no less important.""

A University of Edinburgh spokeswoman said it had been ""shocked and deeply saddened by what happened"" to Romy and ""deeply sorry"" for the gaps in support given to her.

""Supporting our students' mental health and ensuring their wellbeing is our absolute priority,"" she said. ""Our support policies and practices are under regular review as we continue to focus and improve upon our mental health support provision and provide the best possible environment for our students.""

Students at the university now have access to a ""named-contact relationship"" with staff trained in wellbeing and mental health, alongside other support services.

The spokeswoman added: ""We continue to engage with students through both the Students' Association and the Sports Union to identify how best we can shape and develop our services to support students most effectively.

""We work closely with the three other universities in Edinburgh and NHS mental health colleagues to improve pathways into specialist mental health services for students.""

The Department for Education previously responded to the petition by saying that higher education providers already had a ""general duty of care not to cause harm to their students through their own actions"".

A spokesperson said: ""We acknowledge the profound and lasting impact a young person's suicide has upon their family and friends, and know among the petitioners there are those who have personal experience of these devastating, tragic events.

""[However] we... feel further legislation to create a statutory duty of care, where such a duty already exists, would be a disproportionate response.""

In a response to the petition, the Scottish government said: ''We are determined to support the mental health of all students. Over the last three years we have invested £11.5m to introduce additional counsellors in colleges and universities''.

Levi Davis was last seen in Barcelona on 29 October - witnesses say they saw a man in the water of the city's port the next morning

Spanish police have said they are investigating the possibility that missing British rugby player Levi Davis drowned.

Levi was 24 years old when he disappeared in Barcelona shortly after arriving in the city from Ibiza by boat.

He has not been heard from since the last confirmed sighting on 29 October.

Mossos d'Esquadra - Catalan Police - told the BBC its main theory is that Levi fell into the sea.

Police divers can be seen in the clip entering the waters close to where Levi is thought to have disappeared.

The force previously confirmed it had received reports from cruise ship staff who said they saw a man in the water on the morning of 30 October.

Levi's mobile phone was last located in the port area that morning, and his passport was found there in November after his disappearance was reported.

Detectives previously said they were trying to establish whether there was any criminal involvement in Levi's disappearance.

In its latest statement, Mossos d'Esquadra said the new search was trying to find ""any evidence that could confirm the theory of a possible accidental death"".

However, it said the case remained open and the latest developments were in response to new information.

A spokesperson said the force was keeping in ""constant"" contact with Levi's family.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Levi's mum has shared the last video message from him sent just hours before he disappeared

Levi, who had played rugby for Bath and Worthing, appeared on Celebrity X-Factor in 2019.

He'd signed a record deal and was due to release his second single last November.

Before his disappearance, he'd spent about two weeks staying with a friend in Ibiza before heading to Barcelona.

He was recorded on CCTV outside the Old Irish Pub in the city centre, and sent several voice notes and messages before contact was lost the next morning.

Levi's mum Julie Davis, from Solihull in the West Midlands, has previously criticised the speed of the investigation.

More recently, she has urged people not to spread conspiracy theories about his disappearance online.

Alberta has declared a state of emergency after wildfires spread across the western Canadian province, driving nearly 25,000 people from their homes.

Faced with more than 100 wildfires, Alberta's Premier Danielle Smith called the situation ""unprecedented"".

Residents of Edson, a town of more than 8,000, were told to leave immediately.

Ms Smith said a hot, dry spring had created ""so much kindling"" and some 122,000 hectares (301,000 acres) had burned so far.

Many of the fires are burning out of control, fanned by strong winds.

The worst-hit areas include Drayton Valley, about 140km (87 miles) west of the provincial capital Edmonton, and Fox Lake, some 550km north of the city, where 20 homes were consumed by fire.

Fire"

Edmonton Expo Centre is accommodating more than 1,000 evacuees and in the town of High Level a curling rink is being turned into a temporary shelter.

Artian Lushaku died four days after he was struck by a car in the north of Glasgow

A 13-year-old boy has died four days after being hit by a car in Glasgow.

Artian Lushaku was critically injured when he was struck by a Toyota Aygo on Balmore Road, in the city's Lambhill area, at about 17:55 on Wednesday.

Police Scotland said he died from his injuries at the Royal Hospital for Children on Sunday.

Officers urged anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward and said they were particularly keen to speak to the driver of a white van.

Sgt Nicholas Twigg said: ""This is a deeply distressing time for Artian's family as they try to come to terms with his death.

""It's imperative we establish the full circumstances of the collision and our investigation remains ongoing.

""We are keen to hear from the driver of a white van who was in the area around the time of the incident and we would ask them to get in touch with us as we believe they could assist with our ongoing investigation.""

Artian had been a pupil at Cleveden Secondary School for two years.

Headteacher Claire Wilson said the school community was devastated by his death and said the 13-year-old was loved by everyone who knew him.

She said: ""He has left such a mark on our school with his confident, outgoing, friendly, caring and enthusiastic nature. Artian brought a sense of fun to anything he set his mind to.

""He will also be remembered for his sporting talents, and we will all miss him.

""The awful events of last week have been a shock to everyone and our thoughts and loving prayers are with Artian's family and friends at this deeply distressing time.

""We will do everything we can to support our school community over the coming days and months.""

The closing speeches of the Agreement 25 conference hailed the renewal of relationships between London, Dublin and Brussels.

Rishi Sunak described his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar as “my friend”, and paid tribute to the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for helping create the “breakthrough moment” of the Windsor Framework.

Von der Leyen underlined the improvement of UK-EU relations since Sunak became prime minister, saying “we agreed to focus on the road ahead, rather than past disagreements”.

Varadkar noted an observation made by many involved in the peace process in recent weeks - that “Northern Ireland works best when the British and Irish governments work together”.

Varadkar and Sunak echoed each other in referring to the late David Trimble’s Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech - referring to hills ahead, but mountains behind.

The theme was clear - the difficult relations in the years following the Brexit referendum were now in the past.

The strengthening of bonds between international leaders may help increase the pressure for a restoration of Northern Ireland’s devolved government.

But ultimately Sunak, Varadkar and von der Leyen do not have the power to bring back power-sharing in Belfast.

The rules of cross-community consensus in the peace settlement mean a Stormont Executive can be formed only when unionists and nationalists agree to take part together - and there is no imminent sign the Democratic Unionist Party is planning to lift its veto.

Aldi, Lidl and Asda have joined rival supermarkets Sainsbury's and Tesco in cutting the price of milk by at least 5p.

The retailers are reducing the price of a pint to 90p, in order to match other grocers.

While the drop will be welcomed by people struggling with higher living costs, milk still costs more than double the average price before Covid.

In March 2020, a pint of milk was around 43p, according to official data.

All five supermarkets have confirmed the reductions in price will not affect how much they pay farmers.

Tesco said it made the decision because its costs for buying in milk had fallen.

Asda said that it had taken ""swift action to reduce the price of milk as commodity prices have eased"".

Arla, the UK's largest dairy producer, said in March that the wholesale price of milk was already expected to fall by around 5.3p per litre this month because of rising supplies and falling demand from cost-conscious shoppers.

The move comes at a time when food inflation is at its highest level since 1978. The latest official data shows that food prices increased by 18.2% in the year to February.

Milk alone has risen by 43% in price over the same period, one of many staples, including cheese and eggs, which have surged in cost and squeezed household budgets.

Some analysts have suggested that supermarkets reducing their prices is a possible sign that hikes in the cost of a weekly shop could be starting to ease.

Arthur Fearnall, a farmer and board director at Arla Foods, said: ""While some prices for dairy categories are seeing early signs of levelling out, the severity of the on-going cost of living crisis and volatile economic environment is continuing to negatively impact consumer demand for both conventional and organic milk.""

Paul Savage, agriculture director at Arla, said milk supplies in the UK rose by 3.2% in March compared to the same month last year. ""When coupled with a decline in dairy consumption and an overall decline in shopping spending, with 75% of people cutting expenditure on food, this is creating a change in the supply and demand of milk,"" he said.

Sainsbury's said with ""costs going up, we are working hard to keep prices low, especially on the everyday essentials people buy the most"".

Recent research revealed nine out of 10 shoppers reported feeling concerned about rising food prices, according to Barclays.

Around 62% said they were finding ways to reduce the cost of their weekly shop, a report showed.

On Thursday, Tesco announced its full-year results and admitted that customers had faced ""an incredibly tough year"" with prices soaring.

Tesco's chief executive Ken Murphy said that he expected prices to keep rising throughout the first half of this year but they would then ""moderate"".

Tesco said that while its full-year sales had risen by 7% to £66bn, pre-tax profits dropped 51% to £1bn. It said it had faced ""unprecedented"" rises in prices charged by its suppliers.

Separately, Sainsbury's has announced a major restructuring of how its logistics operations work, affecting around 7,000 staff throughout the country.

The company said that no one would lose their job or get moved to worse contractual terms.

The Duke of Sussex has blamed alleged illegal intrusion into his private life by journalists for the break-up of his relationship with Chelsy Davy.

In a witness statement, Prince Harry claimed Ms Davy decided that ""a royal life was not for her"" following repeated acts of harassment.

The claims emerged in a High Court case against Mirror Group Newspapers brought by several high profile figures.

MGN denies allegations of voicemail interception in the cases.

It also claimed some of the cases being brought are beyond a legal time limit.

Ms Davy and Prince Harry were in an on-off relationship between 2004 and 2010.

In a summary of his witness statement, the duke's lawyers alleged unlawful activity ""caused great challenges"" in the relationship, and led Ms Davy to decide that ""a Royal life was not for her"".

This included journalists booking into a hotel in Bazaruto, a small island off the coast of Mozambique, where Harry and Ms Davy had tried to escape to in order to ""enjoy some peace and quiet"", the document reads.

The lawyers also said that mobile phonecalling data to be used in the trial shows that Ms Davy was targeted for voicemail interception between"
75,"2007 and 2009.

The activities caused him ""huge distress"" and ""presented very real security concerns for not only me but also everyone around me"", he said, adding that they also created ""a huge amount of paranoia"" in future relationships.

""Every time he was in a relationship, or even a rumoured relationship, that whole person's family, and often their friends, would be 'dragged into the chaos' and find themselves the subject of unlawful activity on the part of MGN,"" lawyers said.

Prince Harry's lawyers allege that his mobile phone number was recorded in a handheld device belonging to ""prolific hacker and head of news at the Sunday Mirror"" Nick Buckley.

The prince is also expected to allege that he experienced what was, in hindsight, voicemail interception in relation to 30 people with whom he had a close relationship.

He is expected to give evidence in June - the first time a senior royal will be a witness in court in modern times.

MGN has not admitted to any of the charges, although it said it ""unreservedly apologises"" for a separate instance of unlawful information-gathering against Harry and said that the legal challenge brought by the prince ""warrants compensation"".

The article that incident referred to - regarding an MGN journalist instructing a private investigator to unlawfully gather information about Harry's activities at the Chinawhite nightclub on one night in February 2004 - is not one of the claims being brought by the prince.

MGN said it would never be repeated.

In written submissions, MGN's barrister, Andrew Green KC, said the publisher denied that 28 of the 33 articles in Harry's claim involved phone hacking or other unlawful information gathering.

He said that stories came from a variety of other sources - including other members of the Royal Family.

Mr Green added that it was ""not admitted"" that five of the 33 articles contained unlawful information gathering.

Other celebrities have brought claims against MGN, with ""test cases"" - including Prince Harry's - selected to go to trial from the wider group of claimants.

They include that of former Coronation Street actress Nikki Sanderson, comedian Paul Whitehouse's ex-wife Fiona Wightman and actor Michael Turner - who played Kevin Webster in Coronation Street and goes by his stage name Michael Le Vell. All are expected to give evidence during the six- to seven-week trial.

The court heard that Ms Sanderson felt like she was ""public property"" and experienced abuse in the street following ""false insinuations"" in articles published by MGN.

""[She had] people shouting at her in the street calling her a 'whore', 'slag' or 'slut' and even being physically assaulted on numerous occasions,"" barrister David Sherborne said.

Mr Turner was accused by fellow cast members of being a ""mole"" amid alleged phone hacking, the court heard.

The hearing is focusing on what senior executives at MGN knew about alleged phone hacking - including TV host Piers Morgan, who was editor of the Daily Mirror between 1995 and 2004.

Mr Sherborne told the court that unlawful information gathering was both habitual and widespread at three papers - the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People - between 1991 and 2011.

He described ""a flood of illegality"", adding that ""this flood was being authorised and approved of"" by senior executives.

The barrister also accused executives of misleading the Leveson inquiry - the inquiry into the practices, culture and ethics of the press - something it denies.

In written arguments, Mr Sherborne said it was ""inconceivable"" that Mr Morgan and other editors did not know about MGN journalists instructing private investigators to obtain information.

""The systemic and widespread use of PIs [private investigators] by MGN journalists to unlawfully obtain private information was authorised at senior levels,"" Mr Sherborne, who is also representing the duke, said.

Mr Morgan has repeatedly denied any knowledge of phone hacking or illegal activity at the Daily Mirror when he was editor.

""I've never hacked a phone. I've never told anybody to hack a phone,"" he told the BBC's Amol Rajan in an interview conducted before the trial began.

MGN has previously settled a number of claims against it in relation to stories obtained through unlawful means.

US singer Pink has announced she will kick off her 2024 UK tour in Cardiff.

The Grammy-winning star announced on Tuesday that she is to play Principality Stadium on 11 June next year.

The gig will mark five years since she last played there.

The 44-year-old said she was excited to be back in Wales during the month that the stadium celebrates its quarter-century.

""Starting the tour in Cardiff is going to be so fun,"" said Pink.

""It's been way too long since I've been in Wales and to celebrate the 25th anniversary of this amazing venue is going to make it even more special.

The announcement means it is going to be a busy few months for the stadium

""See you there, love bugs,"" she added.

Tickets for the Cardiff leg of Pink's Summer Carnival tour will go on pre-sale from Monday 27 November at 10:00 GMT and then on general sale from Thursday, 30 November at the same time.

The announcement means 2024 is already shaping up as a busy year for the Principality Stadium, with concerts by Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift and Foo Fighters all taking place throughout May and June.

Last updated on .From the section Millwall

Millwall's owner and chairman John Berylson died from injuries sustained after his car overturned and hit a tree in the United States.

Police in Falmouth, Massachusetts, say no other vehicle was involved in the crash on Tuesday.

Emergency services responded shortly before 08:00 local time and found Berylson, the sole occupant, trapped inside the car.

The 70-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene.

The cause of the crash - described by Millwall as a ""tragic accident"" - remains under investigation.

American businessman Berylson became a significant shareholder of Millwall in 2007 after he led a consortium which invested in the south-east London club, then in League One, and became chairman in October that year.

The Championship side hailed him as ""a person of such remarkable generosity, warmth, and kindness"", while former players and rival clubs have also paid tribute.

Falmouth Police Department said preliminary investigations into the crash showed that Berylson was driving his Range Rover south on Sippewissett Road in Falmouth, a coastal town on Cape Cod, when it lost control on a curve and left the road.

The car then rolled over into a ravine and came to rest against a tree.

Berylson was trapped inside the vehicle and was ""extricated by mechanical means"". He subsequently ""succumbed to injuries received in the crash"".

The crash is being investigated by the Falmouth Police Department and the Massachusetts State Police.

Berylson, who lived in Wellesley Hills in Greater Boston, is survived by wife Amy and children Jennifer, James, and Elizabeth.

A US policeman who saved a driver from a fiery crash has been hailed a hero. Sergeant Ashley Taylor was called to Highway 46 in southern Georgia after reports a car had veered off the road. Bodycam footage shows him running to the scene of the crash, smashing the car windows and pulling a woman to safety despite the growing flames. Local media reported the driver was having a medical emergency and is expected to make a full recovery.

Kathleen Poole faces deportation from Sweden despite living in the country for nearly two decades

A pensioner with Alzheimer's faces being split from her family and deported to the UK from Sweden, after nearly two decades in the country.

Sweden has ordered British-born Kathleen Poole, 74, to leave after her application to remain in the country post-Brexit was not accepted, her family told the BBC.

They said it was ""disgraceful"" Sweden wants to deport the grandm"
76,"other.

The Swedish government said authorities are in contact with the family.

Mrs Poole - who moved from Macclesfield, Cheshire, nearly two decades ago to Sweden to be closer to her family - is currently bedbound and receives round-the-clock care in a home where she has been living for the last 10 years.

The grandmother-of-four's family was told in September 2022 she would be deported, despite making her application for Swedish residence status before the December 2021 deadline brought about by the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.

Her family said her application was rejected because she did not have a valid British passport - which they said she did not need as she could not travel due to her poor health - and despite sick notes from doctors.

Speaking to the BBC, daughter-in-law Angelica said: ""I sent six doctors' notes. I sent personal letters explaining the situation and it wasn't good enough.

""In the end they said 'sorry' you have to leave the country.

""Then they wanted us to book her a flight to the UK, which we refused. So now the British embassy are having to look for accommodation and the police are on their backs.

""I think it's disgraceful really how you can deport somebody who is sick and take her from her family. She's one of the nicest people you will ever meet.""

The family are now hoping a sick note from a doctor, who has visited Mrs Poole in person at her care home, will persuade the Swedish Migration Agency to reopen the case. But in the meantime, Angelica said her children remain worried sick that the grandmother may be sent away from them.

""It's not human to split somebody bedridden from her family,"" Angelica added.

""All this is due to Brexit. The way I see it she's lived here for 19 years this year.""

The grandmother-of-four has been living in a care home in Sweden for the last ten years

MP Hilary Benn, former Brexit Select Committee chair, has urged the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to intervene in the case.

He said: ""The continuing threat by the Swedish authorities to deport this frail elderly woman is heartless and inexplicable.

""It is also in clear breach of the EU/UK Withdrawal Agreement which promised to protect citizens' rights.""

The follow-on legislation from Brexit, which ended freedom of movement, allowed EU citizens resident in Britain to apply to permanently live in the UK. Some EU nations also opted for this system to allow Britons to remain resident in their country.

David Milstead, part of the British in Sweden campaign group, told the BBC he was disappointed but not surprised by Mrs Poole's case and that the UK and European Commission needed to look at the wider issue in the Scandinavian nation.

He said: ""Sweden's approach to implementing the Withdrawal Agreement has led to a lot of long-standing residents being forced out of their homes.

""Sweden has issued more deportation notices to UK nationals during 2021-2022 than any other EU country.

""This is in spite of the Withdrawal Agreement containing protections that should ensure that people like Mrs Poole get to stay. These protections clearly aren't working.""

Sweden has expelled 1,100 British nationals since Brexit, according to the Guardian, which first reported Mrs Poole's case.

Jane Golding, chair of the British in Europe group and a Berlin-based lawyer, has written to the European Commission about Mrs Poole and said she understands they are following up the case with Swedish authorities.

She told the BBC: ""The problem that Kathleen Poole's family has come up against is that the UK and some EU countries including Sweden, decided to go for a system where citizens had to reapply for their status post-Brexit.

""We warned that it would be vulnerable and elderly people who would suffer as a result. People like Kathleen Poole - someone who has lived in another country for years and whose residence now depends on a successful application and is not capable of making the application herself.

""Each EU country implements the Withdrawal Agreement nationally and there are differences in approach. That is why guidance across the EU on cases involving the vulnerable and elderly who have problems applying would help.""

In a statement, Sweden's Minister of Migration Maria Malmer Stenergard said: ""Decisions related to residence applications are applied directly by the Swedish state agencies and courts in line with the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.

""As laid down in the constitution, the Swedish government is not permitted to interfere in or comment on individual decisions taken by these independent state bodies.

""With regard to the case in question, I have been informed that the Swedish Migration Agency is in contact with the family concerning additional information.""

A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are supporting a British woman and her family in Sweden.""

The US Supreme Court has struck down US President Joe Biden's proposal to wipe out billions in student debt.

The 6-3 ruling effectively cancels the plan, which would have forgiven about $10,000 (£7,800) per borrower - and up to $20,000 in some cases.

The decision affects the loans of more than 40 million Americans.

It has left the US public ""angry,"" Mr Biden said. He pledged to put in place new measures to reduce university debt using other existing laws.

The loan forgiveness plan has been in limbo since some conservative states sued, arguing the president overstepped his authority. The Supreme Court agreed.

In the wake of the decision, Mr Biden spoke from the White House, saying: ""I know there are millions of Americans in this country who feel disappointed and discouraged or even a little bit angry. I must admit I do too.""

But he vowed to work with the Department of Education to find other means to help people ease the financial burden.

""Today's decision has closed one path. Now we're going to start another,"" he said.

The total federal student debt has more than tripled over the past 15 years, rising from about $500bn in 2007 to $1.6tn today.

Last year, the US Treasury took a $430bn charge to cover $300m in costs associated with the loan forgiveness programme, as well as additional costs associated with an extension of a Covid-era moratorium on payments through the end of the year.

The Biden administration faced plaintiffs in two separate cases, one involving six Republican-led states - Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina - and the other involving two individual student loan borrowers.

In both cases, plaintiffs argued the executive branch did not have the power to so broadly cancel student debt.

The Supreme Court ruled the two individual borrowers did not persuasively argue they would be harmed by the loan forgiveness plan, effectively ruling that they had no legal standing to challenge the Biden administration's proposal.

During arguments in February, the Biden administration said that under a 2003 law known as the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act, or Heroes Act, it had the power to ""waive or modify"" loan provisions to protect borrowers affected by ""a war or other military operation or national emergency"".

In its ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that while the act allows Mr Biden's education secretary, Miguel Cardona, to ""make modest adjustments and additions to existing provisions, not transform them"".

Justice John Roberts wrote that the modifications made by the Biden administration ""created a novel and fundamentally different"" loan forgiveness programme that ""expanded forgiveness to nearly every borrower"" in the US.

He added that the administration's use of the Heroes Act ""does not remotely resemble how it has been used on prior occasions"".

The high court's ruling fell along ideological lines, with its three liberal judges dissenting.

In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that ""the result here is that the court substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch in making national policy about student-loan forgiveness"".

""Congress authorised the forgiveness plan... the [education secretary] put it in place; and the president would have been accountable for its success or failure,"" she wrote.

""But this court today decides that some 40"
77,"million Americans will not receive the benefits of the plan (so says the court) that assistance is too 'significant'"".

The White House had previously estimated that almost 90% of US student borrowers would have qualified for relief under the plan.

""This decision is going to impact a lot of people in this country. But it's disproportionately going to impact people who are already historically marginalised,"" Ranen Miao, a 22-year-old recent graduate told BBC News outside the Supreme Court.

""The people who take out student loans are not the children of millionaires and billionaires. They're the children of working families,"" added Mr Miao, who declined to disclose how much student debt he has.

Clegg Ivey told CBS, the BBC's US partner, the Supreme Court had ""made the right decision"" and that he disagreed with the Biden administration's approach to the issue.

""I have student loans and I certainly would have benefited,"" he said. ""But if that's what we want, let's talk to our congressman. Congress... should actually do its job.""

Polling data shows that support for the student loan forgiveness proposal largely fell along political lines.

One poll conducted by Marquette Law School in May found that 31% of Republicans favoured the proposal, compared to 69% of independents and 87% of Democrats.

The Supreme Court's ruling on Friday was swiftly applauded by senior Republican lawmakers.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the loan initiative is ""unlawful"" and would mean that Americans without student loans ""are no longer forced"" to pay for those who do.

In total, approximately 43 million people in the US owe money for student loans - or about one-in-six US adults with at least some post-secondary education.

Federal reserve data shows that the median student loan is about $17,000. About 17% of borrowers owe less than $10,000, while about 7% owe over $100,000.

Among those on the high end of the debt spectrum is Satra Taylor, a part-time student and campaigner for the group Young Invincibles who owes about $103,000. She told the BBC she expects the figure to grow as she continues a doctoral programme.

""My family does not come from generational wealth. I had no other option but to take out student loans to ensure I could put food on my table and pay my rent,"" she said.

""I'm deeply saddened by this decision... but I'm also hopeful that President Biden will ensure student debt cancellation happens.""

Tim Westwood worked for BBC Radio 1 for nearly 20 years

Former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood has been questioned for a third time under police caution over alleged sex offences, BBC News understands.

In a statement, the Metropolitan Police confirmed they are investigating five accusations of non-recent sexual offences, alleged to have taken place in London between 1982 and 2016.

Detectives say they interviewed a 65-year-old man under caution on 15 March, 4 April, and 11 July this year.

There has been no arrest.

This comes after BBC News and Guardian investigations uncovered multiple allegations from 18 women of serious sexual misconduct and abuse by Tim Westwood. He denied those allegations.

In April 2022, a number of women accused Mr Westwood, who also worked as a DJ on BBC Radio 1Xtra, of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017.

They also accused him of abusing his position in the music industry. Some of the women told BBC News they encountered Mr Westwood when they were under 18. One said that she was only 14 when Mr Westwood first had sex with her.

The DJ stepped down from his Capital Xtra radio show in April last year.

An external report, by KC Gemma White, looking at what the BBC did and did not know about Mr Westwood's conduct during his near 20-year employment with the corporation, is due to be published this year.

BBC News has tried to contact Mr Westwood for comment.

Stephen Tompkinson told his trial he had acted in self-defence

Actor Stephen Tompkinson has been found not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to a drunken man making noise outside his home.

The 57-year-old actor was accused of punching the man in the early hours of 30 May 2021 in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside.

Newcastle Crown Court had heard Mr Tompkinson's actions caused Karl Poole to fall and fracture his skull.

The DCI Banks star said he acted in self-defence.

Prosecutors claimed he had ""snapped"" and ""lashed out"" at Mr Poole in ""disgust"" at his behaviour.

But Mr Tompkinson told jurors the contact ""wasn't enough to knock a sober man off his feet"".

Mr Tompkinson nodded but showed no visible emotion when the verdict was announced following just under two hours of jury deliberations.

Asked for his reaction as he was leaving court, he told reporters: ""I just want to go home.""

The trial heard Mr Poole and his friend Andrew Hall had been drinking since midnight that bank holiday Sunday and had gone to the beach before walking back.

Mr Tompkinson, who was living with his partner and her seven-year-old son at the time, heard ""strange noises"" at about 05:30 BST.

Jurors were told he called 999 after seeing the two men try to stand up and fall several times while drinking from a bottle of Jagermeister at the bottom of the driveway.

While waiting to be connected, Mr Tompkinson went outside wearing pyjamas and a dressing gown and told the ""heavily intoxicated"" men who he was calling.

He said the pair ""took great objection to me complaining about them being there"" and had started to move towards him.

Karl Poole had told the court he suffered a brain injury after his head hit the pavement

Neighbour Caroline Davidson, who was watching from her bedroom window, told the court she saw Mr Tompkinson slap and punch Mr Poole, causing him to stumble and fall backwards, hitting his head on the ground.

However, Mr Tompkinson, who was born in Stockton-on-Tees, said he could not have punched him because he was holding his phone.

""I didn't want to hurt him, I wanted to stop him to change his mind about coming towards me and further on to my property,"" he said giving evidence.

He told jurors punching a drunk man would have been ""career suicide"" and that he had already lost acting work since being charged.

He told the court he was ""not responsible"" for the brain injuries Mr Poole sustained but that he accepted some accountability.

In his closing speech, prosecutor Michael Bunch had said the actor was ""an expert in playing a part"" and his ""obvious talent makes him convincing in putting across a story"".

Speaking after the jury delivered its verdict, Mr Poole said he was shocked and disappointed.

Chelsea have signed France striker Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig for £52m.

The 25-year-old scored 16 goals in 25 games in the Bundesliga last season.

Nkunku, who has won 10 caps for France, is manager Mauricio Pochettino's first signing since he took charge in May.

""I am incredibly happy to be joining Chelsea. A big effort was made to bring me to the club. I am very excited for this challenge and will be proud to wear the Chelsea shirt,"" Nkunku said.

""Having played in Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga, I now want to play in the Premier League, one of the strongest leagues in the world.

""I am looking forward to meeting my new coach and team-mates and showing the Chelsea supporters what I can do on the pitch.""

Nkunku, whose Chelsea contract starts on 1 July, won three Ligue 1 titles and two French Cups during four years at Paris St-Germain before joining Leipzig in 2019.

He was named Bundesliga player of the season and German PFA player of the season in 2021-22 after scoring 20 goals and contributing 15 assists in the league.

Nkunku scored in the final of the German Cup this month as Leipzig won the competition for the second successive year. They finished third in the Bundesliga last season.

Nkunku made his France debut last year but missed the World Cup campaign because of a leg injury.

Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, Chelsea's co-sporting directors, said: ""Christopher has proved himself one of the standout attacking players in European football over the past two seasons and will add quality, creativity and versatility to our squad.""

Gary Lineker has said he does not fear BBC suspension in an impartiality row over a tweet criticising the government's asylum policy.

The Match of the Day host has tweeted that he is ""looking forward to presenting"" the show on Saturday.

Lineker had compared the language the government used to set out asylum plans to ""that used by Germany in the 30s"".

Speaking to the BBC, the home secretary said the comment ""diminishes the unspeakable tragedy"" of the Holocaust.

Despite the intense criticism, Lineker expects to be retained as a presenter. The BBC has not commented.

He wrote on social media: ""Happy that this ridiculously out of proportion story seems to be abating and very much looking forward to presenting [Match of the Day] on Saturday. Thanks again for all your incredible support. It's been overwhelming.""

Suella Braverman told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast the Nazi comparison used by Lineker was ""lazy and unhelpful"".

The home secretary said her family ""feel very keenly the impact of the Holocaust"" as her husband is Jewish and said it was ""offensive"" to draw the comparison.

When it was put to her by host Nick Robinson that Lineker was passionate about the rights of asylum seekers, she said the Germany comment was an ""unhelpful way to frame the debate"".

The BBC said on Wednesday it was having a ""frank conversation"" with Lineker about the BBC's guidelines on remaining impartial following his Twitter remark.

Asked by a reporter if he regretted the post, the host answered: ""No"".

Pressed on whether he had spoken to the BBC director general, he said he had and that they ""chat often"". Asked if he stood by the tweet, he said: ""Course"".

Speaking in the Commons earlier on Thursday, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said Lineker's remark was ""disappointing and inappropriate"" and referenced her grandmother who escaped Nazi Germany.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Suella Braverman says Gary Lineker's tweet about immigration policy is ""a lazy and unhelpful comparison to make"".

Ms Frazer said it was ""important for the BBC to retain impartiality if it is to retain the trust of the public who pay the licence fee"" but that the broadcaster is ""operationally independent"" of the government.

Former culture secretary Sir John Whittingdale urged the government to ensure ""all those who are presenters on the BBC"" - including freelancers like Lineker - were covered by impartiality rules when the charter was reviewed.

But Richard Sambrook, the BBC's former director of global news, said on Twitter it had ""become unsustainable for the BBC to force freelance presenters to fall in line with BBC policies in their non-BBC activities"".

He added that the policy was ""full of fudge"" and the BBC needed to clarify ""to what extent impartiality rules extend beyond news"".

On Tuesday, Suella Braverman outlined the government's plans to ban people arriving in the UK illegally from ever claiming asylum, in a bid to address a rise in the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats.

Opposition MPs and charities have strongly objected to the proposals, but the PM and home secretary have defended the plan, saying stopping the crossings is a priority for the British people.

Lineker's remarks have been widely criticised by Conservative MPs but he has received support by many on social media who oppose the government's proposals.

In response to some of the criticism, Lineker tweeted on Wednesday: ""I'll continue to try and speak up for those poor souls that have no choice.""

Lineker, 62, who has presented Match of the Day since 1999 also works for LaLiga TV.

The corporation's former editorial policy controller Richard Ayre said the presenter had a choice to make over his role at the BBC.

He said Lineker must consider whether to stay or to leave and ""become a social media influencer"".

Mr Ayre, a former member of the broadcasting regulator Ofcom's content board, said it was ""unacceptable"" to have someone who works for the BBC ""comparing Suella Braverman to the third Reich"".

Asked whether BBC director general Tim Davie may have to let the sports presenter go, Mr Ayre told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't think he is going to have any choice but to let him go unless he can be certain that this is the end of it.""

The former BBC trustee was also asked about BBC chairman Richard Sharp, who is facing criticism over his role in facilitating a £800,000 loan for then-prime minister Boris Johnson.

Mr Ayre said the BBC's chairman was ""hanging by an absolute thread"", adding: ""It is quite likely that, within the next few days or weeks, we'll perhaps see two heads roll - one from the left and one from the right, the chairman and Gary Lineker.

""And then, maybe, once each side has scored a goal, we can get back to normal business.""

Stradey Park Hotel is set to house up to 241 asylum seekers

A legal bid for an injunction to stop a hotel being used to house asylum seekers has failed.

Up to 241 people are now set to be housed in Stradey Park Hotel in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, despite opposition.

The council took the action against a number of associated companies and business directors.

The Home Office said the plans were necessary and that the asylum system was under ""incredible"" strain.

The local authority argued using the hotel for asylum seekers would be a breach of planning conditions.

At a High Court hearing on Friday, Carmarthenshire council failed to get an interim order stopping migrants being sent to the hotel while their asylum claims are processed by the Home Office.

The local authority claimed sending them to the 77-bed site was a change of use from hotel to hostel and a breach of planning rules.

It said the change, which is set to take effect from Monday, would ""undoubtedly"" harm the economy.

This included potentially losing more than 25% of the town's hotel rooms, job losses, cancelled weddings and"
79,"an impact on tourism, a High Court judge in London heard.

Last month 50 full-time and 45 part-time staff at the hotel were told that their jobs would be terminated on 10 July, the same day asylum seekers are due to move in.

The hotel has seen faced local opposition since it first announced the plans

A lawyer for Stradey Park's owner, Gryphon Leisure, said there was an ""urgent"" need for asylum seeker accommodation, arguing there would be no planning breach.

The court was told Gryphon director Robert Horwood had warned there was a ""serious"" risk the hotel would shut without its contract with accommodation provider Clearsprings Ready Homes.

Craig Howell Williams KC, for the council, said there were ""good reasons"" to doubt Mr Horwood's claims the business could face closure.

The barrister said the former Edwardian stately home played a ""fundamental"" role in tourism.

The court was told there was limited information about how the site would be operated for migrants.

The use of bodyguards and perimeter patrols would be ""alien"" in the neighbourhood, Mr Howell Williams said.

He added there were ""concerns"" about community feeling, including the ""potential for unrest"".

Jenny Wigley KC, for Clearsprings, Gryphon, Mr Horwood and co-director Gareth Street, said in written arguments using the hotel was ""a temporary solution of last resort"".

She said if people were not accommodated asylum seekers were at risk of being kept in sub-standard conditions or being made homeless.

Police were called to the hotel on Friday after protesters blocked vehicles entering the site

Judge Gavin Mansfield KC will give his reasons for dismissing the injunction bid at a hearing on Monday.

After the hearing, Carmarthenshire council leader Darren Price said he was ""disappointed"" and that the authority would consider the judge's reasons on Monday.

In May, West Lindsey District Council lost its attempt to get an injunction against work to prepare RAF Scampton, in Lincolnshire, for asylum seekers.

And in June Braintree council lost a High Court appeal over Home Office plans to house asylum seekers at a former airbase.

A successful legal action pursued by Great Yarmouth Borough Council, in Norfolk, saw a High Court judge rule that seafront hotels there could not be used to house migrants.

On Friday, police were called to Stradey Park Hotel as protesters stopping cars from accessing the site clashed with security personnel who were pulling down fences erected by demonstrators previously.

The Home Office said the number of people arriving in the UK in need of accommodation had reached record levels.

""The Home Office is committed to making every effort to reduce hotel use and limit the burden on the taxpayer,"" a spokesman added.

Crowds have lined the streets to celebrate West Ham football club's Europa Conference League final victory over Fiorentina.

The win meant that West Ham achieved the club's first major trophy for 43 years.

Fans of David Moyes' team gathered to watch the trophy parade through the streets of London.

Dr Susan Gilby said she faced ""offensively sexist comments"" in meetings

A former NHS chief executive is suing her employer, saying she was ""bullied, harassed, intimidated and undermined"" by the hospital trust's chairman.

In legal papers, seen by BBC News, Dr Susan Gilby alleges she was effectively unfairly dismissed by the Countess of Chester NHS Foundation Trust, after she made a formal complaint.

She has also accused the chairman of putting finance above patient safety.

In a statement, the trust said it denied all the allegations.

Dr Gilby, a consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care, was appointed as medical director and assistant chief executive of the NHS trust, in August 2018.

Her arrival came a month after nurse Lucy Letby was arrested on suspicion of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill 10 others at one of the trust's hospitals in Cheshire. Ms Letby's trial is ongoing and she denies the charges.

When the chief executive resigned in September that year, Dr Gilby was promoted to the role.

According to documents prepared for a forthcoming employment tribunal, Dr Gilby alleges the problems began when a new chairman, Ian Haythornthwaite, was appointed in late 2021.

She claims that soon after joining the trust, Mr Haythornthwaite - a former BBC accountant - sought to ""intervene and influence, and ultimately to control, many operational matters"" beyond the scope of his job.

Dr Gilby's claim alleges that the chairman had an ""extremely and unnecessarily aggressive"" approach, with subordinates ""increasingly frightened of crossing him"".

She also accuses him of appointing friends to the trust's board and putting finance above patient safety.

Dr Gilby claims the chairman was ""highly aggressive and intimidatory"" in meetings, that he banged his hand on a desk to emphasise his point, and oversaw a climate where ""offensively sexist comments and ferocious and repetitive criticisms"" were made by either him or his associates.

Dr Gilby's complaint accuses the chairman of putting finance above patient safety at the hospital trust

She made a formal whistle-blowing complaint against the chairman in July 2022, raising her concerns about his behaviour to both the trust and NHS England.

The trust responded to her concerns, Dr Gilby claims, by proposing that she be seconded to a senior advisory role within NHS England on the condition she withdrew her allegations.

NHS England also contacted her about a role. Dr Gilby responded to the offer in November saying she was not willing to withdraw her allegations; she was suspended by the trust on 2 December. On 5 December, she gave the trust six months' notice of her intention to resign.

Dr Gilby is suing the trust and Mr Haythornthwaite for constructive unfair dismissal.

In a statement, the Countess of Chester NHS Trust said: ""There are significant points of dispute between Dr Gilby and the trust and the trust denies all allegations that she has raised. A number of active internal investigations are in train and the trust will not provide any further comment whilst those investigations are ongoing.""

Mr Haythornthwaite said he had ""nothing to add at this time"" to the trust's statement.

Washington DC and Philadelphia experienced their worst air quality in years as intense wildfires in Canada continue to impact millions.

The poor conditions have forced event cancellations and grounded flights across the US.

Nearly 100 million people are experiencing very poor air quality in North America.

US President Joe Biden described the fires as a ""stark reminder of the impacts of climate change"".

Data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality Index (AQI) shows that cities in North America had the worst air quality in the world on Thursday morning.

Cities including Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York had significantly worse air quality than cities abroad such as Lahore, Dhaka and Hanoi.

The smoke has caused the cancellation of school outings and sporting events, and, in the capitol, the White House's planned pride celebrations.

The National Zoo was also closed, with its animals, including three giant pandas, taken indoors to shelter.

In nearby Baltimore, residents were wearing masks as they went about their day-to-day activities. One local, Sean Montague, said people ""have to put your health first and be cautious"".

At the city's Inner Harbour, friends Sharifah and Sheila disembarked from a water taxi, eager to hurry indoors.

They said they originally planned to spend the day in Baltimore's Fells Point, a waterside neighbourhood known for its galleries, shops and outdoor seafood restaurants.

But once on the water, their eyes stung and the smoke was so thick, so they agreed the ride was ""miserable"" and decided to return home.

Much of the smoke is coming from Quebec, where 150 fires are burning. It is already Quebec's worst fire season on record.

Some areas of Canada continued to experience very high levels of contamination on Thurs"
80,"day. The city of Janvier in Alberta, for example, had an AQI of 338, far above Washington DC's 293.

Mr Biden said he spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday and deployed more than 600 firefighters to help battle the blazes in Canada.

On a typical Thursday, Washington DC's Union Market would usually be packed with customers, dining al fresco in the afternoon sun.

But with smoke thick in the air, dozens of tables and chairs sat empty. A nearby rooftop bar was completely deserted except for a small group of Canadian tourists, who jokingly apologised for the disruption.

One customer, Tori, sat back in a lone Adirondack chair, with a mask tied around her wrist having just travelled from West Virginia.

""As I was driving, I noticed it was more hazy, and I just feel a little bit different too. I had a headache,"" she said. ""It's very scary, if you think about it.""

Environment Canada said conditions were worsening in Toronto on Thursday, as more smoke poured in. The agency has recommended that anyone outdoors wear a mask.

""These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke,"" the Environment Canada statement said.

In New York, an orange haze blanketed the city's skyline and shrouded landmarks including the Statue of Liberty.

Public health officials have cautioned people not to exercise outside and to minimise their exposure to the smoke as much as possible, as the air poses immediate and long-term health risks.

Canadian officials say the country is shaping up for its worst wildfire season on record.

Experts have pointed to a warmer and drier spring than normal as the reason behind the trend. These conditions are projected to continue throughout the summer.

Fires across Canada have already burned an area that's 12 times the 10-year average for this time of year.

Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.

The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

Experts say exposure to wildfire smoke can cause a litany of health issues, such as an elevated pulse, chest pain, and inflammation in the eyes, nose and throat.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay says next week's strike ""threatens to cause significantly more disruption"" than previous walkouts

The junior doctors' union appears ""intent on maintaining a militant stance"" which ""hampers serious talks over pay"", the health secretary says.

Writing in the Telegraph, Steve Barclay said pay demands by the British Medical Association (BMA) were ""unrealistic"".

Junior doctors in England are set to stage a four-day strike from Tuesday.

The BMA wants a 35% pay rise to make up for 15 years of below-inflation wage rises, It says falling pay has caused a recruitment and retention crisis.

Dr Vivek Trivedi, co-director of the junior doctors' committee at the BMA, said on Saturday that Mr Barclay is yet to put a serious offer on the table.

""All we're asking for is a credible offer that shows us he's serious, that we can start a path of negotiations to try to address the real-terms pay cut,"" he said.

The strike is due to take place from 07:00 BST on Tuesday until 07:00 BST on Saturday.

The NHS national medical director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, is warning that the strike will cause ""unparalleled levels of disruption"" as it is longer than previous strikes and comes after the bank holiday when many staff are ""taking much-needed holiday"".

Up to quarter of a million operations and appointments could be postponed because of it, the NHS Confederation - the body which represents health service trusts - has warned, and health bosses are more concerned about this than they have been about any other strike.

Th BMA has refused to exempt any services but says it has plans to protect patients.

Mr Barclay said the walkout - just after the bank holiday and which ""coincides with school holidays, Ramadan and Passover"", has been timed to ""cause maximum disruption"".

Mr Barclay said pay demands by junior doctors were ""out of step with pay settlements in other parts of the public sector"" and claimed some doctors could receive an extra £20,000 a year if wage demands were met.

He said he wanted to ""see a fair deal that increases their pay"" but could see ""no prospect of getting into serious and constructive talks"" unless the strike action was cancelled and the BMA changed its pay demands.

The BMA says junior doctors' pay has fallen by 26% since 2008, once inflation is taken into account.

Junior doctors represent more than 40% of the medical workforce and include those fresh out of university through to experienced medics with more than 10 years of experience. Around two-thirds are BMA members.

In a ballot issued in February, 98% of eligible BMA members backed strike action, on a turnout of 77%

Deputy chairman of the BMA junior doctors' committee Dr Mike Greenhalgh said falling pay had caused ""a real recruitment and retention crisis"" in the health service.

He told the BBC on Saturday: ""It's hard to negotiate when only one side is doing it, and we're not getting anything back from the government on that front.""

He added: ""We're happy to meet at any time. We would still meet [Mr Barclay] over the bank holiday weekend before the industrial action next week.

""And if he was to bring a credible offer to us, it could still, even at this late stage, avert action.""

During last month's strike, hospitals drafted in consultants to provide cover but it is estimated a quarter of them are on leave due to the Easter holidays.

The BMA says it will not exempt any services but that there are plans to protect patients, which could involve pulling junior doctors off the picket line if individual hospitals report lives are in immediate danger.

The Department of Health and Social Care has said the government is working with NHS England to put contingency plans in place to protect patient safety during the strike.

""The NHS will prioritise resources to protect emergency treatment, critical care, maternity and neonatal care, and trauma,"" a spokesman said.

Rishi Sunak has urged all sides in Russia to ""be responsible and to protect civilians"", as mercenaries from the Wagner group seize military sites from Russia and Vladimir Putin vows to ""punish"" those involved in the move against his government.

In the UK, a meeting of the emergency committee, Cobra, was chaired by Foreign Secretary"
81,"James Cleverly on Saturday afternoon.

We don't get to hear much about what is said in those meetings, but the government says Mr Cleverly received all the latest information and particular attention was paid to the situation of British nationals still in Russia.

Mr Sunak has also spoken to US President Biden, French President Macron and German Chancellor Scholz about the situation.

Speaking exclusively to Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Sunak suggested the government has been watching the internal threats to Vladimir Putin for some time.

He told me: ""We have been monitoring for a while the potentially destabilising impacts of Russia's illegal war in Ukraine.""

And he said the situation was ""evolving on the ground as we speak"".

But he urged calm on all sides, saying: ""The most important thing I'd say is for all parties to be responsible and to protect civilians"", a clear hint that the UK is concerned about how conflict inside Russia's borders could spiral, when for months the focus has naturally been on fighting in Ukraine.

The prime minister did not repeat a more candid assessment from the Ministry of Defence, which said on its official Twitter feed that ""this represents the most significant challenge to the Russian state in recent times"".

But Mr Sunak did not deny that was the case.

With so much unclear, it is evident that Number 10 does not yet want to give an official verdict on what is happening.

Yet it is clear from the Ministry of Defence's comments that the government sees the action taking place as a potential game changer.

The situation is volatile and no-one in Westminster would predict with any certainty what will happen next.

It is not clear exactly what Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's motives are.

Nor is it certain how many resources and men Wagner really has at their disposal.

But one of the questions being asked in Westminster this afternoon is how Ukraine can make the most of what seems like disarray inside Russia to make progress in what is now a long-running conflict.

Our politicians, like the rest of us, are watching events and wondering what on earth is going on, and unable to be sure what will happen next. But they are watching with eager attention.

The war in Ukraine has had such enormous implications for politicians in the UK, because it has indirectly affected every family, every firm, and every household in the country by driving up the cost of energy.

That's one of the biggest factors in high inflation the prime minister describes as the ""number one enemy"".

We talk to the prime minister about that, his plans for the NHS and Boris Johnson in an exclusive interview you can watch on Sunday morning.

But as events unfold in Russia, remember that the actions of one man, Vladimir Putin, upended so much here.

Moscow may be nearly 2,000 miles away, but what happens in the next few days to stability in Russia matters hugely to our politicians in Westminster, and to us all.

Formal identification of the boy who died has yet to take place

An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 17-year-old boy was stabbed following a birthday party in north-west London.

Police and London Ambulance Service were called to Granville Road, Kilburn, at 23:22 BST on Friday following reports of a fight and a stabbing.

A 17-year-old boy was pronounced dead at the scene.

Another teenage boy and a woman in her early 20s were treated at the scene before being taken to hospital.

Formal identification of the boy who died has yet to take place.

Det Ch Insp Mark Rogers said: ""We believe that there was a fight following a birthday party, which would have been attended by a number of people.

""I would urge anyone who was there, and who has not yet spoken with officers, to please come forward.

""It is vital that we establish what happened.""

Ch Supt Dan Knowles, in charge of the North West Command Unit which polices Kilburn, said: ""I know that the community will be shocked by this incident in which a young man has lost his life.""

Notts County had missed out on automatic promotion by just four points to title winners Wrexham Notts County twice battled back from a goal down before beating Chesterfield on penalties in an astonishing National League promotion final at Wembley to reclaim their status as 'world's oldest football league club'. Substitute goalkeeper Archie Mair, brought on to replace Sam Slocombe in the 120th minute, crucially saved spot-kicks from Darren Oldaker and Jeff King before Cedwyn Scott sealed a dramatic 4-3 shootout triumph. Victory for the 161-year-old Magpies, who were founder members of the Football League in 1888, ended their four-year non-league exile while defeat consigned Chesterfield to a sixth season in the National League. Ruben Rodrigues had bounced a volley off the turf and over goalkeeper Ross Fitzsimons to level at 2-2 in the second half of extra time to ensure the showdown would be decided from the spot. Armando Dobra's curled finish had restored Chesterfield's lead in the first period of 15 additional minutes after an enthralling game ended 1-1 at the end of normal time. A calamitous start from Notts goalkeeper Slocombe - which had the Magpies defending a rare indirect free-kick inside the box after just two minutes - cost them dearly as his challenge on Andrew Dallas allowed the striker to put Chesterfield ahead from the spot. The Spireites had Notts scrambling to stay in touch at the break as the side that won a club-record 32 league games during the regular season struggled to muster a meaningful response. Sam Austin sent a shot over the bar from the edge of the area and Connell Rawlinson wastefully steered a header wide for a much-improved Notts after the break. Liam Mandeville squandered a late chance to seal victory moments before experienced Notts midfielder John Bostock caught Fitzsimons out with a set-piece that skipped in at the near post. Dobra edged the Derbyshire club back ahead three minutes after the restart and, after Macaulay Langstaff and Rawlinson went close to again restoring parity, it was Rodrigues who sent the final to a shootout.
• None Relive the National League promotion final as it happened After four years and three failed play-off attempts - including defeat by Harrogate in a 2020 promotion final played behind closed doors at Wembley during the Covid-19 pandemic - Notts finally secured their English Football League (EFL) return at the end of a record-breaking season. Luke Williams' side were pipped for automatic promotion and the title by Hollywood-funded Wrexham, who topped the table with an all-time high 111 points. The 107 points the Magpies collected to finish second would have got them straight up as champions in every other season before this one. The club-record wins total and 117 goals in a campaign - which included a record 25-game unbeaten league run between September and February - would have counted for nothing if they had lost at the national stadium. Chesterfield finished one spot below Notts in the table, but the gap between the two was 23 points. They were the only side, other than Wrexham and Notts, to have a spell at the top of the table after the first month of the season - and they pushed Notts to their limits at Wembley in an incredible energy-sapping game. Chesterfield were presented with a bizarre chance almost immediately after kick-off when County conceded an indirect free-kick in the penalty area. Notts set their entire side up a yard in front of the goalline to block King's effort from the left of the penalty spot, but the uncertain start by the Magpies quickly got worse. Slocombe raced out to try shut Dallas down on the edge of the area, but caught the Spireites forward as he tried to lift the ball beyond the keeper. Dallas collected himself and went straight down the middle to beat Slocombe from the spot to put Chesterfield ahead after five chaotic minutes. Nervy Notts struggled to match frenetic Chesterfield for much of the first half, but Austin had a chance to level from close range in the 17th minute when he stretched to meet a lofted cross from Aaron Nemane. Dallas continued"
82,"to torment Notts' backline down the left, calling Slocombe into action as the forward attempted pull a dangerous ball back across goal. It was not until the 37th minute that Notts managed to register a shot on goal with Nemane sending an effort directly into Fitzsimons' hands. Austin and Rawlinson were off target in search of a second-half equaliser, only for Bostock to deliver with a clever free-kick after a Slocombe error at the other end almost gifted Chesterfield the win in normal time. Dobra had Chesterfield ahead again in extra time and while Langstaff went close to adding to his National League record 42 goals and Rawlinson also flashed a chance wide, it was Rodrigues who salvaged Notts' hopes. On-loan keeper Mair, in just his fifth game for Notts, played an instrumental role off the bench with his penalty saves and, after Bostock made a mess of his spot-kick to seal it, Scott kept his cool to secure victory.

Allister Brown has twice before broken the world record for longest drumming marathon by an individual

A Lisburn man has smashed the world record for the length of time spent drumming.

Allister Brown, who is 45, surpassed his previous record of 134 hours and five minutes, by drumming for more than 150 hours.

He finished his ""drumathon"" on Saturday afternoon, after starting last Sunday.

Mr Brown took on the challenge in memory of his late partner Sharon Deegan, who passed away from pancreatic cancer in January 2021, aged 49.

Speaking on Saturday afternoon, at the Lisburn Music Centre where he secured his third world record, Mr Brown said it had been a ""massive undertaking"".

He said that the memory of Ms Deegan, as well as the support of his friends, kept him going during the attempt.

""Thank you to everyone who has supported me,"" he said.

""I always had it in my mind I wanted to do this in Sharon's memory.""

Mr Brown has twice before broken the world record for longest drumming marathon by an individual, first in 2003 when he drummed for 58 hours, and again in 2008 when he lasted just shy of 103 hours.

He said that his previous attempts had prepared him well for this latest marathon.

""The experience has been absolutely phenomenal for me; to have that knowledge of how to prepare, how to deal with certain situations during the marathon,"" he told BBC News NI.

""This one has ran really well and I'm so thankful to the team that I've had that wanted to help me out.""

The Guinness World Records rules state that for every hour of drumming Mr Brown is allowed a five-minute break.

He was able to save up these breaks, allowing him to take slightly longer periods of respite.

Allister Brown (right), had support including from his friend and event coordinator Duncan Campbell

But by Friday morning, five days into his record attempt, Mr Brown's friend, and event coordinator, Duncan Campbell, said the drummer had only slept for about two hours during the attempt.

""Certainly this is a challenge where you are doing an endurance against the mind,"" said Mr Brown.

""At certain points I'm going to be hallucinating and the team are there to help me out.

""My body will maybe want to try and make me sleep in the early hours of the morning, so the team again will be trying to keep me awake and make sure that my breaks are allocated correctly and that I'll be able to get the rest when needed.""

The attempt was livestreamed and held in aid of charity.

""With Sharon passing away from pancreatic cancer I'm raising money for [pancreatic cancer charity] NIPANC, and I'm also raising money for Mind, a charity which is for mental health, because I suffered a bit with mental health issues after Sharon's passing so I thought it would be best to coincide the two together in this event,"" he said.

Over the past two decades the world record for longest drumming marathon by an individual has been traded between Mr Brown and a few other drummers around the world.

While his latest total is impressive, he does not think it is unbeatable.

""Nothing is impossible if you have the right mindset and people around you. If anyone wants to try and beat the record, I'm willing to help them,"" he said.

As for his plans on completing the marathon, he said: ""The first thing I'll be looking to do is find somewhere comfortable to sit down and probably just fall asleep.""

All except the shortest wars have times when killing is an unchanging, grim routine. There are also moments, like the last few days in the Middle East, when events leave belligerents and their allies at a crossroads with big decisions to make.

Choices are confronting leaders in the governments and armed forces in Israel and Tehran, at Hezbollah's HQ in the southern suburbs of Beirut and further afield in the Gulf, Europe and America.

The killing of foreign aid workers in Gaza might finally exhaust the considerable patience of Israel's allies, led by the United States.

Israel and Egypt have banned foreign journalists from entering Gaza, except on occasional, highly controlled and brief visits with the Israeli military. Belligerents need to win the media battle in an age of asymmetric warfare where victory or defeat can rely on perceptions as much as the realities of battle. Journalists are also denied access to a war when the parties fighting it have something to hide.

But even without foreign reporters on the scene, evidence is piling up that Israel is not, as it claims, respecting its obligations under the laws of war to respect civilian lives, or allowing the free movement of aid in a famine created by Israel's own actions. After the World Central Kitchen team was killed in Gaza, President Biden used his strongest language yet in public statements to condemn Israel's actions.

The president and his aides have now to decide whether words are enough. So far, they have resisted calls to put conditions on the use of American weapons in Gaza, or even to turn off the supply line.

While the weapons still arrive, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who depends on hardline Jewish ultranationalists to stay in office, might feel he can still afford to defy President Biden. A major test will be the offensive Israel wants to attack Hamas in Rafah, plans the US believes would compound the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. American interests and Joe Biden's political prospects in an election year have already been damaged by what is seen in many countries as complicity with Israel.

In another change this week, Mr Netanyahu has come back to work after two days off for hernia surgery to huge demonstrations demanding his resignation and early elections for a new parliament. Deep cultural and political fissures between Israelis that were put to one side after 7 October are wide open again and being shouted about in the streets. The prime minister is in political trouble, blamed by his opponents for letting down Israel's guard so badly that Hamas detected a chance to attack.

Millions of Israelis who believe they are fighting a just war against Hamas have no confidence in Mr Netanyahu. Their charge sheet includes prolonging the war to put off the moment when he is held accountable for his mistakes, failing to bring Israel's hostages home safely, and alienating vital allies starting with President Biden. Add to that the fact that after a huge onslaught over six months Hamas is still fighting, and its senior leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar is still alive somewhere in the Strip.

Another new set of calculations about the next stages of the crisis in the Middle East arise from"
83,"the assassination of a senior Iranian general in Damascus, widely assumed in Israel to be the work of its air force. It was a coup for intelligence services that missed or ignored the Hamas attacks six months ago. It was also an escalation in the wider war in the region that will have consequences.

Some of them may happen close to where I'm writing this, looking across the Sea of Galilee towards the Golan Heights, the large swathe of southern Syria that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. As the crow flies, Damascus is less than 50 miles from here. The border with Lebanon is close by. At night, especially, there is constant Israeli air activity, with the roar of jets on patrol, or heading off to bomb Lebanon or Syria.

A shadow war has been fought here in parallel with the war in Gaza since last October. It started with Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement attacking Israel, in support of Hamas in Gaza. It was not the onslaught that the Hamas leadership was hoping for - neither Hezbollah or its patrons in Tehran wanted an all-out war with Israel and, indirectly, its American backers. The Americans did not want that either and restrained Israel's instinct to respond in full force.

But Hezbollah still tied down thousands of Israeli troops and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilians from the border areas. Israel's response, limited compared to earlier border wars, forced the displacement of at least as many civilians on the Lebanese side.

Since the start of this year it has been different. Israel has been setting the pace, bombing its enemies deeper inside Lebanon and Syria. The biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on Monday with the assassination by air strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital.

Iran accuses Israel of carrying out the deadly air strike on its consular building in Damascus

In interviews here in northern Israel local officials and residents have expressed strong support not just for the assassination but for an invasion of south Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah and force them back from the border.

They were not put off by Israel's experience in the last two decades of the 20th Century, when it occupied a broad strip of South Lebanon to try to protect northern Israel. It even created its own Lebanese militia to help with the fighting. The Israelis pulled out in 2000, under constant military harassment from Hezbollah, after prime minister Ehud Barak, a former head of the army, decided that occupying south Lebanon (Israel called it the ""security zone"") did not make Israelis any safer and wasted the lives of its troops.

I walked through the ruins of the Avivim winery, which is right on the border wire. It was destroyed in a Hezbollah strike last week. Its owner Shlomi Biton showed me through the wreck of his business. He is 47 and was born in Avivim, which like the rest of northern Israel has become a ghost town after the evacuations. Shlomi fought in Lebanon during his military service, and now believes that the only way to restore a decent and safe life is for Israel to return to Lebanon for a decisive battle with Hezbollah.

""There's no other choice,"" he told me next his burnt-out business. ""Otherwise, the community won't return to live here, maybe just a few crazy guys like me - the children won't come back.""

In Kiryat Shmona, a border town where 25,000 Israelis lived, no more than 3,000 people, mostly soldiers and essential workers, are left. The Mayor, Avichai Stern, showed me deserted districts and wrecked buildings. He believes that Israel can remove Hezbollah's threat to the north with a decisive and destructive invasion on the lines of the Gaza war.

The Mayor of Kyriat Shmona, Avichai Stern shows fragment of shrapnel from a Hezbollah strike on residential buildings in the town

Mayor Stern said last year 10,000 Hezbollah fighters practised taking over northern Israel.

""It can happen here"" he told me, ""just like Gaza. They weren't training to direct traffic in Beirut. The only way to stop it is to go into Lebanon eliminate this threat as soon as possible.""

Exactly six months ago, in deadly secrecy, Hamas was putting the finishing touches to the battle plan it called Operation al-Aqsa flood. The killing on 7 October and everything that has followed destroyed lazy, wishful thinking that it was possible to manage the century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.

Hamas thrust the conflict back to the top of the world's agenda when it killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and took more than 250 Israelis and foreign citizens into Gaza as hostages. Many of the 134 Israelis still there are thought to be dead. It was Israel's worst single day since it won its independence war in 1948.

The ""mighty vengeance"" that Mr Netanyahu promised has so far killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, a majority of whom were civilians. Israel's American-supplied firepower has flattened most of Gaza. The war has spread across the Middle East. It might now be entering a new phase.

The borderlands between Israel and Lebanon are deceptively beautiful in the first few weeks of spring. Wild flowers and pinecones, not shrapnel, were underfoot as I walked along a stretch of the border with Israeli military officers. Any sense of peace was, of course, an illusion on one of the most dangerous borders in the Middle East. Iran and Hezbollah are making decisions about how to respond to the assassinations in the Damascus and the way Israel is increasing the military pressure in Lebanon. The two allies will want to calibrate their response to avoid a wider, devastating war that neither want.

Israel does not want that war either. But the audacious assassination at the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus could be a sign that Israel believes Iran and the network it calls its axis of resistance might blink first. If so, it is a risky strategy. Iran will want to restore its ability to deter Israel, which is clearly not working. It will try to respond in a way that will catch Israel by surprise.

The empty overgrown border communities are not likely to be Iran's first choice for retaliation. They could try an Israeli target in another country, or cyber-attacks rather than missiles. Or intensify their nuclear programme.

An American envoy, Amos Hochstein, is trying to find a way to revive the UN Security Council resolution that ended the last big war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. Neither side has respected it, but it provides a framework for negotiation.

At this crossroads, neither Israel, Iran nor Hezbollah wants an all-out war that would have terrible consequence for all of them. But no side seems ready to stop the slide towards it.

Don't trust anyone who tells you they know the political implications of this indictment.

I certainly don't, and nor do they. We don't know the charges, we don't know the evidence and we don't know how the trial will unfold.

Since the indictment was announced, I've heard from people close to the former president who've told me this is bad news for Democrats because this is a weak case, the weakest of all the potential cases against Trump.

I've also heard from Democrats who say the spectacle of Trump on trial is bound to weaken him as he runs for the White House, and the reminder of his alleged affair with a former porn star will turn off evangelical Christians who once supported him.

Two things can be true at once.

The political question will be in the raw numbers: does it win him more voters or lose him voters?

The more important question for America is whether this trial, whenever it occurs, can be removed from the political realm and be seen as a fair legal process.

Last updated on .From the section Women's Football

Domestic women's football could become a ""billion pound industry"" in 10 years' time says former Lionesses midfielder Karen Carney - the chair of a major review into the sport.

Her 126-page report recommends the top two tiers of women's football in England being"
84,"fully professional.

It also calls for a new regular broadcast slot for women's football to be made available on television.

""It is what needs to be done, to move the sport forward,"" Carney said.

The ex-Birmingham and Chelsea player added: ""Full-time is full-time. Go for it. Realistically the biggest issue we need to go after is professionalising the women's game and bringing standards up because that is a big problem.""
• None The Sports Desk podcast: Can women's football be a billion pound industry?

Describing women's football as a ""start-up business"", Carney said everyone involved from sponsors, broadcasters and the Football Association ""has a responsibility to invest in the game and move it to the next level"".

She added: ""If you are starting something you have to have an influx of money and I really do believe that in 10 years' time this sport could be a billion pound industry.

""But these standards and investment are the foundations that lead us to this point. I really do think we will make it [money] back.""

An independently club-owned, club-run body is poised to take over the Women's Super League and the Women's Championship next year as the English women's game looks to capitalise on its rapid rise, accelerated by the Lionesses' success at Euro 2022.

A recent report by Deloitte showed Women's Super League club revenues rose by 60% in the 2021-22 season, showing signs of growth before even England's historic Euro 2022 victory.

Combined revenue for the WSL clubs was £32m, an increase of £12m on the previous season thanks in part to a new broadcast deal, however clubs still recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss of £14m.

Carney's findings have focused on several areas including audience reach and growth, the financial health of the game, its long-term financial sustainability and its existing structures - leading to 10 major recommendations, that include:
• None World leading standards for players, fans, staff, and everyone in the women's game.
• None To restore the talent pathway needed to create future generations of Lionesses.
• None Professionalisation across the top two tiers to attract and develop the best players in the world.
• None To address the lack of diversity across the women's game - in on- and off-pitch roles.
• None The game's governing bodies to work with broadcasters to create a new dedicated time slot.
• None More investment in grassroots facilities and better access for females.

Carney, who has worked in the media since her retirement from playing in 2019, was asked to examine issues affecting the game at elite and grassroots levels in September 2022. by the UK government.

The women's game has made huge progress in recent years and, at grassroots level, has become the most played team sport for women and girls in England, with three million registered players and over 12,000 registered teams.

However, both the Covid-19 pandemic and the men's game fan-led review highlighted the shallow resources within women's elite football.

She appointed a number of experts from across sport and business, including a senior NFL executive, with the UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer calling it an opportunity to ""revolutionise the game"" in a positive and sustainable way.

In a statement the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Maheta Molango called the report a ""brave, ambitious and detailed plan for the future of women's game"".

An FA spokeswoman said they would help ""address the challenges and opportunities in the report"" to ""deliver the changes needed"".

They said: ""These are exciting times for the development of the women's game and we share Karen's vision of creating world leading standards for players, fans, and everyone involved in women's football.""

While the 12-club WSL is fully professional that does not extend to English women's football's second tier.

A significant drop in broadcast fees and FA central funding means that turnovers can be as high as around £7m in the WSL but as low as £150,000 in the Women's Championship, where player wages can be below £5,000 per year.

Reading's recent relegation from the WSL saw them revert to part-time football due to the financial implications.

When it was put to Carney that more than £10m would be required to redress some of that balance, she passionately defended the need to attract additional income to the game.

""Do I want players to have to go on the NHS [for treatment of injuries]? No. Do I want players to have to use bin bags for curtains? No,"" she said.

""I don't want any of this situation any more. There was a lot of evidence in the review of the marketing strategy in place not being able to help the revenues grow.

""It is what is needed. It is not a negative to invest in women's sport, we have to change the mindset. I understand there is a reality to it.""

On proposals to provide one source of funding from levelling FA Cup prize money across the men's and women's game, she added: ""I'd hope there would not be a backlash.

""There are so many issues and women's sport has struggled for so long I'd hope there'd be an understanding but with anything there'll always be someone who will challenge it.

""I could have said equalise prize money right now but that would have taken down the pyramid of men's football. We should absolutely be going for equal prize money [in the future] from the FA Cup and the FA should be putting a timescale on that.""

'Five weeks out can turn into five months' - injury improvements

A long-standing issue that Carney is keen to see addressed urgently is the relative lack of medical support offered to female players in comparison to their male counterparts.

A Fifa report in 2021 showed that a quarter of top-division women's clubs around the world do not employ a physio or team doctor and while there have been improvements Carney says there are still issues around the quality and continuity of care provided.

""There was a player who should have been out for five weeks and was out five months,"" Carney said.

""We've seen players pretty much say we are going to have to go into early retirement because of the medical situation. It is a systemic issue about women's health not just in sport but outside, it has to be better.

""Don't forget in the Championship there are players working three of four jobs. They are never going to be able to compete and it is not because they don't have the ability, it is the resources.

""Are they hydrated? Are they getting the right nutrients to perform? Are they fatigued? That is why we want minimum standards to come in to keep that competitive nature.

""We want all our players to be fit, available and playing because then the product is at its best because that's what the fans, broadcasters and players want.""

Football's governing bodies have talked of exploring whether WSL fixtures can be televised on Saturday afternoons to help grow the audience.

Last term, WSL matches consistently kicked off at 11.30am on Saturdays and 6.45pm on Sundays to avoid scheduling clashes with men's games.

No matches are currently shown during the '3pm blackout' slot in order to encourage attendance at games.

However, Carney believes there is no simplistic solution: ""It's very clear we need to find a slot specific for women's football.

""Men's football is really easily signposted, it is really difficult for women's football to have a slot and stand out.

""We have to look at it, it is a really saturated market and this is what we are up against.""

'We need to keep pushing' - improving diversity

Carney's 'raising the bar' review also identifies the need to create a workforce strategy for the women's game and the need to create greater diversity on and off the pitch.

Former Brighton defender Fern Whelan, who is now an equalities executive at the PFA, echoed those comments in response to the report.

""We can all see that there is a lack of representation across the women's game,"" Whelan said.

""That isn't by design, or something the game needs to be defensive about. It's something where we've acknowledged there is an"
85,"issue and begun to take action, but we need to keep pushing.

""It's positive that the review has highlighted the lack of diversity across the women's game as something that needs to be urgently addressed.

""Are we doing enough to encourage girls and young women from diverse backgrounds into the game? Are we making the professional pathway accessible enough? It's often about practicalities as well as culture.""

This is a highly significant moment in English women's football.

The report has strong backing from the PFA and FifPro, who have worked closely with the review board to ensure players from all backgrounds have been able to share their experiences in confidence.

There is a range of issues which will need long-term vision and patience to adapt to, but there are also clear short-term recommendations.

Among the most crucial are improved medical support, calls for fully funded union representation, better prize money and a dedicated WSL broadcast spot - all of which can be addressed immediately.

There are no legal enforcements given its an independent report, but the simple fact so many have come together to provide a detailed review suggests it will be hard for the likes of the FA - and the WSL takeover company - to ignore.

Ukraine found the remains of British World War Two Hurricane aircraft in a forest outside Kyiv

The rusting remains of eight British Hurricane fighter planes dating back to World War Two have been found buried in a forest in Ukraine.

The aircraft were sent to the Soviet Union by Britain after Nazi Germany invaded the country in 1941.

They were part of a package of allied military support for the USSR, paid for by the United States under the so-called Lend-Lease scheme.

Similar legislation is being used by the US government today to send military aid to Ukraine as it seeks to expel Russian forces from its country.

Aviation experts say this is the first time the remains of so many Hurricanes have been found in Ukraine.

""It is very rare to find this aircraft in Ukraine,"" says Oleks Shtan, a former airline pilot who is leading the excavation. ""It's very important for our aviation history because no Lend-Lease aircraft have been found here before.""

The UK sent some 3,000 Hurricanes to the Soviet Union during the war against Nazi Germany

The Hawker Hurricane was the workhorse of the Battle of Britain - the air campaign of 1940 when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defeated German attempts to invade the UK. Although its role has often been overshadowed by the newer and more adaptable Spitfire plane, the Hurricane actually shot down more than half of all enemy aircraft during the battle.

""The Hurricane was a strong, easy to fly machine,"" Mr Shtan says. ""It was stable as a gun platform and suitable for inexperienced pilots. A reliable aircraft.""

In total, about 3,000 Hurricanes were sent to the USSR between 1941 and 1944 to support the Soviet war effort. Most were either destroyed in combat or dismantled later for parts.

But some Hurricanes were deliberately broken up and buried after the war so the Soviets did not have to pay back the United States. Under the Lend-Lease legislation, the USSR was required to pay for any donated military equipment that remained intact after hostilities ended.

This was the fate of the eight Hurricanes found buried in woodland south of Kyiv - now the capital of independent Ukraine, but until 1991 part of the USSR.

Ukraine is now painstakingly cleaning and repairing the planes, so they can be put on display

They had been stripped of their instruments, radios, machine guns and any useful scrap metal. They were then dragged by tractors from a nearby airfield, broken up and dropped without ceremony into a shallow ravine. It is thought they were then covered with earth by bulldozers.

The remains were discovered recently after an unexploded bomb dating from the war was found nearby. The rest of the ravine was checked using metal detectors and the Hurricanes were found.

The National Aviation Museum of Ukraine is now in the process of painstakingly excavating the site by hand. Staff there aim to identify as much of the aircraft as possible so they can be reassembled and put on display.

Valerii Romanenko, head of research at the museum, says the Hurricanes played an important part in Ukraine's history.

""The Hurricanes are a symbol of British assistance during the years of the Second World War, just as we are very appreciative of British assistance nowadays,"" he says. ""The UK is one of the largest suppliers of military equipment to our country now.""

The Hurricanes are a symbol of British assistance... just as we are very appreciative of British assistance now

""In 1941 Britain was the first who supplied fighter aircraft to the Soviet Union in mass scale. Now the UK is the first country which gives Storm Shadow cruise missiles to our armed forces.""

It is thought there are just 14 restored Hurricanes able to fly in the world today.

After the German invasion, the USSR lost many warplanes and was in desperate need of fighter aircraft. Initially several RAF Hurricane squadrons were sent to the Arctic to help.

But soon the British pilots left and the aircraft were taken over by Soviet airmen. Records show that many disliked the Hurricane, considering it under-powered, under-armed and under-protected.

By the end of the war it was considered obsolete and was used mainly for air defence work. The eight Hurricanes found south of Kyiv were used to defend major transport hubs - especially railway stations and junctions.

Bryn Parry founded Help for Heroes with his wife Emma

The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to a co-founder of Wiltshire-based veterans' charity Help for Heroes following his death from pancreatic cancer.

Bryn Parry passed away on Wednesday at the age of 66, the charity said.

Mr Parry and his wife Emma founded Help for Heroes in 2007 after learning about ex-servicemen's struggles to access rehabilitation treatment.

Prince William described him as ""a life-affirming and inspirational man"".

In a tweet, the prince said he was ""deeply sad to hear that Bryn Parry has passed away"".

""A life-affirming, inspirational man, his work with @HelpforHeroes made a difference to so many and his legacy will be its continuing impact.""

Prince William visited a Help For Heroes Recovery Centre in Tidworth in 2013

Prince Harry also expressed his condolences in a statement published on his own veteran's charity, the Invictus Games Foundation.

""Today is a truly sad day for the military community as we bid farewell to a man who, alongside his wife, completely transformed the UK charity sector for the benefit of those that have served,"" he wrote.

""His vision, determination and brilliance provided a lifeline for thousands of veterans, as well as their families, when they needed it most.""

The minister for veterans' affairs, Johnny Mercer, also paid tribute, saying Mr and Mrs Parry had ""revolutionised veterans' care in the UK"".

The MP for Plymouth, Moor View, added: ""(Mr Parry) inspired me with his unapologetic determination to do the right thing by these men and women who serve.

""He will never be forgotten.""

Mr Parry, who forged a career as a cartoonist after leaving the Royal Green Jackets, initially set out to raise £10,000 for wounded veterans with his wife through a charity cycle ride.

Within three years the couple, who are from the village of Downton near Salisbury, had raised £50m.

The charity's chief executive James Needham said: ""Without Bryn, this charity wouldn't be here. Without him, over 27,000 veterans and their families wouldn"
86,"'t have received life-changing support.

""Bryn was instrumental in changing the focus of the nation and the way we regard both military service and wounded veterans.""

He added: ""Bryn's founding principles and his no-nonsense approach of doing everything humanly possible to help our heroes, remain at the heart of all we do.""

Help for Heroes hold charity bike rides every year to raise funds for the Armed Forces community

Speaking to the BBC in 2010, Mr Parry said he and his wife felt there had been a lot of pent up public support for veterans that had no outlet.

""The problem was, people were concerned about the politics and the rights and wrongs of the wars,"" he said.

""We said it's not about the rights and wrongs of war, it's about a 22-year-old boy who's had his legs blown off.

""That allowed people to get behind the movement. It's just been a humanitarian desire to do something, and not stand around and feel helpless.""

Mr Parry's cartoon business, Bryn Parry Studios, announced earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer and would not be taking on any new commissions.

In a statement on its website, it said: ""He is comfortable at home, surrounded by his family and mad dogs!""

Emergency services were called to Bordon, Hampshire after reports of a man trapped in a hole

A man has been rescued after falling into a well that suddenly opened up in a back garden.

Emergency services were called to Bordon in Hampshire, at about 18:00 BST on Tuesday, after reports of a man trapped in a hole.

The 76-year-old man fell 2m (6.5ft) and suffered minor cuts and bruises, according to Hampshire's fire service.

It said water had caused part of the well to erode, creating a void underneath a garden patio.

""He was fortunate not to slide down the slope where he could have dropped approximately 12 metres further into the well,"" the service said in a statement.

Firefighters worked along with paramedics to save the man and set up a rope system that lifted him from the well.

He was treated at the scene by paramedics and a cordon was put in place around the hole.

The fire service praised its crews for their ""quick and efficient response"".

The research rocket was part of experiments being conducted by Sweden in zero gravity

Sweden has got into hot water with Norway after one of its research rockets malfunctioned and landed in its neighbour's territory.

The rocket was launched at 07:20 local time (05:20 GMT) on Monday from the Esrange Space Center, before plunging into a Norwegian mountain range.

The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), which owns and runs the centre, has apologised and is investigating.

But Norwegian officials say Sweden failed to let them know formally.

""The ministry did not get formal notification, and when an incident like this happens across the border it's important that those responsible immediately inform the Norwegian authorities through proper channels,"" said foreign ministry spokeswoman Ragnhild Simenstad.

According to the SSC, the rocket reached an altitude of 250km (155 miles) and made it into zero gravity, where it carried out experiments in microgravity into potential carbon-free fuels and creating more efficient solar cells.

But the rocket then landed some 40km north-west of the planned landing site, 15km into Norwegian territory in the far northern area of Malselv. It is described as a mountain range roughly 10km from the closest inhabited area, at an altitude of around 1,000m (3,280ft).

Nobody was injured and no material damage has been reported.

The scientific instrument onboard the rocket, known as the payload, weighs 387kg (853lbs) and has since been recovered in ""good condition"" and returned to Esrange by helicopter, according to the SSC.

SSC spokesman Philip Ohlsson explained that while the first stage motor of the rocket had landed close to the Esrange base site in Sweden, the second stage motor and the payload had parachuted on to Norwegian territory.

""This is a deviation that we take seriously,"" said Marko Kohberg from the Esrange Space Center. ""It is still too early to speculate about the cause, and we await more information from the current investigation.""

According to Esrange, Norway's armed forces and Swedish authorities were contacted shortly after the incident, and it followed the routines laid out for rocket launches after Monday's flight.

Local authorities in Malselv have told public broadcaster NRK they were told about the incident and asked if a helicopter could be sent to retrieve the rocket.

But Norway's foreign ministry has said it received no formal notification either of the rocket's landing or the recovery of its payload.

""For our part it's important to remember that a rocket and incident like this can contribute to large damage. The fuel might be contaminated and there might be poisonous material. We just want to expect the proper rules are followed,"" said Ms Simenstad.

The rocket, known as Texus-58, is part of a European programme commissioned by the European Space Agency.

Researchers say the new genetic map of humanity is more representatives of variety

Scientists have produced an updated map of all human DNA which could help to transform medical research.

The original human genome, published 20 years ago, is mostly from one person, and does not represent human diversity.

The latest version - dubbed the pangenome - is made up of data from 47 people from Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe.

It is hoped it will lead to new drugs and treatments that work for a much wider range of people.

According to Dr Eric Green, who is director for the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda Maryland, the research, which has been published in the journal Nature, has the potential to transform medical research.

""This represents a tremendous scientific achievement. A pangenome that better reflects the diversity of the human population will enable scientists to better understand how genetic variation influences health and disease and moves us to a future in which genomic medicine benefits everyone"".

The genes that make up human DNA are made up of of sequences of chemicals.

The pangenome consists of 47 separate DNA maps of the people from different ancestries, which can also be combined and compared with new software tools to find important genetic differences.

The aim is to develop more effective treatments for more people, but genetic scientists are aware that the research has the potential to be misused. Prof Muzlifah Haniffa, of the Sanger Institute in Newcastle, who was not part of the research team, said that the science should not be misinterpreted,

""Genetic information about diversity should be used responsibly and not to provide evidence of differences in race, which is a social construct. We have to understand what it shows and, importantly, what it doesn't show. We have to make sure that taking information very superficially to establish false racial characteristics does not happen"".

The human genome was largely completed in 2003. It is a map of the basic chemical building blocks that make up human DNA. Researchers use it to identify genes involved in diseases so as to develop better treatments. It has led to improved cancer therapies and the development of tests to predict the onset of inherited conditions, such as Huntington's disease.

It took hundreds of machines 13 years to read all the DNA that makes a human

But the downside is that 70% of the genome came from a single individual: an American man with European and African ancestry. This therefore misses important genetic differences that play an important part in diseases in people from other backgrounds, according to Dr Karen Miga of the university of California in Santa Cruz.

""Having one map of a single human genome cannot adequately represent all of humanity. This reboot can be the foundation for the scientific community to have more equitable healthcare in the future"".

Although the map of the human genome currently used by researchers has a lot of African DNA in it, counterintuitively it is the population that is"
87,"one of the most lacking, according to Dr Ewan Birney, deputy Director General of the European Molecular Biology Lab near Cambridge.

""The most important place in the World to get genomes from is sub-Saharan Africa. It is where we started as a species, and it has the greatest genetic diversity. So, one African American genome is not enough to represent that diversity"".

Dr Zamin Iqbal, a senior researcher at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge, believes that a more representative genome will lead to better treatments for more people.

""Expanding the range of populations present in the human reference genome will reduce a long-standing implicit bias in studies of human genetics. Humans are diverse, and it's important that our analytical methods incorporate that.

Two recent studies in the US and in the UK and Ireland found that children of European ancestry were twice as likely to be diagnosed with genetic tests than those of African ancestry.

Dr Alexander Arguello, who is the programme director at at the National Human Genome Research Institute, says the aim of the new project was to change those outcomes.

""The hope is that once you capture sufficient diversity you will get the same diagnostic results whatever the population"".

The new pangenome is made up from 47 people, half of whom have ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa, a third from the Americas, 13% from China and 2% from Europe, with representation of indigenous people.

But this is just the start of an ambitious programme to better represent the diversity of the world's population. The initial aim is to increase the number to 350. After that the scientists leading the largely US programme plan to increase numbers and diversity further by working with organisations from other countries in what they hope will become phase two of the human genome project.

The settlement is separate from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, which started in September 2017

Lawyers acting for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and bereaved family members have been outlining the details of a civil damages claim settlement.

At the High Court, barrister Richard Hermer KC said a compensation sum of about £150m had been awarded across 900 cases in the ""global settlement"".

The June 2017 fire at the west London tower block killed 72 people.

Meanwhile, it has now been confirmed the Grenfell Inquiry report is unlikely to be published until 2024.

The panel and team working on the phase two report have insisted they will ""spare no effort"" to finish it as soon as possible. Its final hearing was on 10 November 2022.

The long-running inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, is examining the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the blaze.

At the settlement hearing at the High Court, listings indicate the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was one of a number of defendants.

The London Fire Commissioner was also listed as a defendant, while cladding giant Arconic previously confirmed it was another. The firm said it had ""agreed to contribute to a restorative justice project to benefit the community affected by the fire"".

A total of £50m, including £25m from government and £6m from Arconic, has been pledged to the settlement fund.

Those who took part in the claim were represented by 14 legal firms although the settlement does not include all victims of the fire.

It has been stressed that the agreement does not affect the potential for any criminal charges to be brought in the future.

Mr Hermer said: ""No amount of money will ever truly compensate for what the claimants have had to endure.

""This is a settlement purely of the civil claims for compensation. The settlement does not right the wrong, it does not secure accountability.""

The judge, Senior Master Barbara Fontaine, specifically approved financial arrangements regarding the claims made by eight children, as part of the wider settlement. Lawyers said she would examine issues such as investment arrangements for these claimants.

Noel Hanna died at a camp after making his descent from the world's 10th highest mountain

Mountaineer Noel Hanna, who has died during an expedition in Nepal, ""lived for the mountains"", his sister has said.

It is understood Mr Hanna, from Dromara in County Down, died at a camp while making a descent from Annapurna, the 10th highest mountain in the world.

The 56-year-old had scaled Mount Everest 10 times in his career.

In 2018, Mr Hanna became the first person from the island of Ireland to successfully summit and descend K2.

Mr Hanna had scaled the 8,091m (26,545ft) peak in the Annapurna mountain range on Monday and died overnight, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports.

BBC Nepali said there were local reports that his body has been airlifted to the capital, Kathmandu.

Irene Hunter told BBC News NI's Evening Extra that her brother ""loved a view and he just loved people"" and that he was ""a legend"".

Asked if the family was aware of the dangers which Mr Hanna faced, Ms Hunter said: ""He didn't really say too much, he didn't want to worry us all.""

She added that her brother's body would be returning to Finnis, close to the Mourne Mountains, where he began his climbing career.

There are reports that a second climber from India who had been missing after falling into a crevasse has been found alive.

Annapurna in the Himalayas is the 10th highest mountain in the world

Robbie Marsh, a guide in the Mourne Mountains, described Mr Hanna as an inspirational figure within the climbing community.

He told BBC News NI: ""I was always at him to write a book, but he was such a humble man.

""He just normalised climbing 8,000 metre mountains, just like we would do Slieve Donard.""

Mr Marsh said he was inspired by Mr Hanna to quit his corporate management job to set up his mountaineering business.

""Part of his legacy is that inspiration that he has given people,"" he said.

Robbie Marsh was inspired to set up a mountaineering business by Noel Hanna

Banjo Bannon, a climber from Newry, who was the second person from Northern Ireland to reach Mt Everest in 2003, said: ""Noel had it in his head that he was going to do all 14 peaks over 8,000m. That was his goal and dream.""

Alison Irwin, a representative from the Nepal Ireland Society, said Mr Hanna did a lot of work in promoting connections between the two countries.

""He had a huge love of Nepal, through his mountains, and was very, very interested in all things Nepal,"" she said.

Ms Irwin described feeling delighted for Mr Hanna when she heard he had reached the peak of Annapurna this week.

She added: ""The first thought that came into my head when I saw the summit news was, 'well, I hope he gets down safe'. And I woke up this morning to that bad news.""

The society has extended condolences to Mr Hanna's family.

Ms Irwin said Mr Hanna's proudest achievement was reaching the summit of Burke-Khang (6942m; 22775ft), which she said some sherpas described as ""unclimbable"".

""He was very modest in his achievements,"" she added.

Noel Hanna previously told the BBC he relishes the challenge of tackling the world's highest mountains

Mourne Mountain Adventures, a guided hiking company based in Kilkeel, has paid tribute to Mr Hanna.

In a social media post, the company said: ""There is some peace in that he spent his last moments doing what he loved best, such a great man and one of N Ireland's finest mountaineers.""

Dan McFarland, the head coach at Ulster Rugby, tweeted: ""Very sad to hear of Noel's passing. Noel was a great inspiration to this team.

""All our thoughts are with Lynne and Noel's family.""

Ireland's Department of"

GPs in England may start offering weight-loss jabs to some patients to reduce obesity-related illnesses and resultant pressure on hospitals.

Wegovy was approved for NHS use after research suggested users could shed over 10% of their body weight.

The drug blunts appetite, so users feel full and eat less.

Rishi Sunak said it could be a ""game-changer"" as he announced a £40 million pilot scheme to increase access to specialist weight management services.

But experts warn ""skinny jabs"" - widely used in the US and endorsed by many celebrities - are not a quick fix or a substitute for a healthy diet and exercise.

In trials, users often put weight back on after stopping treatment.

Similar injections, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, which work in much the same way as Wegovy but are designed to treat diabetes, have not yet been approved for NHS use specifically for weight loss.

NHS drugs watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), says patients can access Wegovy for a maximum of two years via specialist weight-management services.

These are largely hospital based, meaning only about 35,000 have access, but the government says tens of thousands more could be eligible - although the UK has no supply of the drug yet.

The new scheme will test how GPs could safely prescribe such drugs and the NHS provide support in the community or digitally, contributing to the government's wider ambition to reduce pressure on hospitals and give patients access to the care they need where it is most convenient for them.

Semaglutide injections will be approved under NICE guidance

Mr Sunak said: ""Obesity puts huge pressure on the NHS.

""Using the latest drugs to support people to lose weight will be a game-changer by helping to tackle dangerous obesity-related health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer.""

Professor Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, welcomed the move but said there would need to be ""sufficient resource and funding to account for the increased workload"".

She added that there also needs to be enough of the drug available ""so as not to raise patients' expectations, as there may be a significant number of people who would benefit from it"".

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Health Secretary Steve Barclay pointed to the impact obesity has on rates of cancer and diabetes.

He continued: ""We recognise it's often a real challenge for people to lose weight or keep the weight off, and that's why we're embracing the latest medication and making sure the NHS is at the front of the queue.""

Mr Barclay also said there could be ""potential economic benefits"" from reducing the numbers of people absent from work because of health issues linked to obesity.

The government says obesity costs the NHS in England £6.5 billion a year, with more than one million hospital admissions linked to obesity in 2019-20.

More than 12 million adults in England are obese, estimates suggest.

And some High Street chemists are set to sell Wegovy to customers, prescribing and dispensing a weekly jab they can inject themselves using pre-filled pen devices.

As with any medication, there can be side-effects and risks.

The most common are nausea or an upset stomach, bloating and gas.

NHS medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said: ""Pharmaceutical treatments offer a new way of helping people with obesity gain a healthier weight and this new pilot will help determine if these medicines can be used safely and effectively in non-hospital settings as well as a range of other interventions we have in place.""

He said NHS England was negotiating with the manufacturer to secure long-term supplies at prices representing value for money for taxpayers.

Pupils were allowed to leave the school after being locked down for the morning

A teenage boy is being questioned on suspicion of the attempted murder of a teacher who was stabbed at a school.

The male teacher was taken to hospital with a single wound after being attacked at Tewkesbury Academy in Gloucestershire just after 09:00 BST.

Firearms officers arrested the suspect two hours later in Stoke Orchard, about three miles (4.8km) away, and a knife was seized.

The injured teacher was discharged from hospital on Monday evening.

Tewkesbury Academy has said it would reopen on Tuesday.

Gloucestershire police received a call from the ambulance service on Monday morning saying a teacher had been injured in a corridor at the school.

Officers said a ""thorough"" search was conducted after initial reports suggested the boy was still on the school's property.

""It was initially thought that the suspect had fled the scene and hidden himself within the school grounds,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Richard Ocone, of Gloucestershire Police.

""This search was both complex and meticulous in nature as we sought to ensure there were no further injured parties as well as seeking the arrest of the suspect,"" he added.

Two other schools also went into lockdown following the stabbing and further searches were conducted to make sure no-one else was hurt.

""Specialist resources including the National Police Air Service and plain-clothed officers were deployed to search the wider area,"" said ACC Ocone.

One teacher kept his pupils safe by sitting in front of a classroom door and barricaded it, said one parent.

Daniel said his daughter video called him and he could see her teacher ""supporting the whole class"".

""The teacher sat right by the door. He barricaded the door, put some boxes there and kept everyone cool even though he must have been scared himself,"" he added.

Michelle, whose 13-year-old son Alex is in Year 8, said she was very relieved to be able to collect him from school.

""You get the message from school to say it has been locked down and it says urgent,"" she said.

""Then you hear that a teacher has been stabbed and the children are all locked down. The first instinct is to get to the school as quickly as you can, which I didn't do, and I listened to the school and stayed away as long as I possibly could.""

Michelle said the teacher involved was ""very popular"" with parents and pupils alike.

Emergency services were seen outside Alderman Knight school, which shares the same site

Police said they were keeping an ""open mind"" about a possible motive and more patrols would be seen in the area.

""At this time there is no evidence to suggest it is terrorism related. However, we are keeping an open mind while further enquiries are carried out,"" said ACC Ocone.

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the stabbing.

""We are closely monitoring the situation and remain hugely grateful to the emergency services who are currently on the scene,"" added Ms Keegan.

""My department is on hand to support the school as the situation unfolds.""

Martyn and Julia, parents of Year 7 student Katie, said the school and police had kept them informed.

""The school was communicating throughout the morning. The students were allowed to turn their phones on, which we were most grateful for.""

Julia said: ""Hearing about it this morning felt very strange - it doesn't happen here. I know it sounds a cliche and you see it happening on the news in other places.""

Erica, who has a child at Tewkesbury Academy, said she was happy that the incident was resolved quickly.

""It is worrying that these things can happen in any school and all the more important that as parents we take responsibility for teaching our children awareness of the destructive nature of this type of incident,"" she said.

Parents said the police and school had kept them informed

Richard Stanley, leader of Tewkesbury Borough Council, said it had been a difficult day for the community.

""Tewkesbury is a very safe place, it's a small community and I don't think there's a particular issue here. It's a national issue"
89,"in terms of young people carrying knives.""

Laurence Robertson, Conservative MP for the town, said he planned to meet with the education secretary and the home secretary to discuss knife crime.

""The government has taken certain steps to bring it [knife crime] back under control, but I would be the first to say that much more needs to be done,"" he told BBC Points West.

Following the incident, The National Education Union (NEU) tweeted that its thoughts were with all staff, pupils and parents involved.

""This is a shocking incident. Violence has no place in our schools and colleges,"" it said.

ACC Ocone said: ""This was clearly a very distressing incident and our thoughts are with the victim, their family and everyone impacted by what happened.

""We are working with the school and other agencies to ensure appropriate support is available and local people will see more police in the area over the coming days as the investigation continues.""

Matt Hancock is among three MPs facing probes by Parliament's standards commissioner Daniel Greenberg, it has been disclosed.

The ex-health secretary is being investigated for allegedly trying to influence the commissioner's enforcement of the rules.

A spokesman for Mr Hancock said he was ""shocked and surprised"" by the investigation.

He added that Mr Hancock denied trying to lobby the commissioner.

The investigation was revealed by an update to the commissioner's website, which confirmed that a probe was launched on Tuesday.

It also confirmed Scott Benton is under investigation for his use of his parliamentary email address, without offering further information.

Mr Benton has been suspended as a Conservative MP since referring himself to the commissioner after he was filmed offering to lobby ministers for a fake company in a newspaper sting.

The website said Mr Hancock is under investigation for potentially breaching a rule in the MPs' code of conduct that prevents them from lobbying the commissioner in a way ""calculated or intended to influence his consideration"" of whether the code has been breached, without offering details.

Mr Hancock's spokesman confirmed Mr Hancock had written to Mr Greenberg ""in good faith"" to offer evidence for an inquiry he is currently conducting, but did not offer further information.

""It's clearly a misunderstanding and Matt looks forward to fully engaging with the commissioner to clear this up,"" the spokesman added.

Mr Hancock, who became one of the best-known politicians in the country during the Covid pandemic, remains suspended as a Tory MP for for taking time off from his parliamentary duties to appear on I'm A Celebrity last year.

It led to widespread criticism, with his local Conservative Association in his West Suffolk constituency passing a motion to say he was ""not fit to represent"" the seat.

He confirmed in December that he will not be standing as an MP at the next election, saying he wanted to find ""new ways to reach people"" outside Parliament.

The commissioner's website also confirmed that Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley in West Sussex, is under investigation for his use of taxpayer-funded stationery, again without offering details.

The BBC has contacted Mr Smith and Mr Benton for a comment.

A relatively new and dangerous street drug called monkey dust, which is already banned in the US, could soon face tougher penalties in the UK.

The government is asking officials about the drug that can cause violence and paranoia - some users have jumped off buildings or tried to eat glass.

The city of Stoke-on-Trent has seen a big rise in users and related crimes, including arson.

Reclassifying it from Class B to A would increase jail terms for dealers.

Stoke-on-Trent South MP Jack Brereton says he is pleased the government is taking action.

He said: ""It's a hallucinogenic drug, and many people's lives have been completely destroyed as a result of taking this drug.

""There is no treatment for those who become addicted - and it is very addictive. For those who succumb to it, it's very profound.""

He said users could become a danger to themselves as well as others.

The effects can vary considerably from user to user.

Police officers have described tackling those under the influence as like trying to wrestle with the Incredible Hulk.

""It's so cheaply available, it's cheaper than the price of alcohol and people are able to just pick it up readily. We need to see reclassification and put the consequences up for those who are pushing this drug.""

According to Mr Brereton, a hit can cost as little as £2 to buy on the street.

Monkey dust is the street name for methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinohexiophenone or MDPHP, which is a synthetic cathinone.

It is a white or yellowish powder that is sold by dealers as an alternative to drugs like speed, ecstasy or cocaine.

Users snort it or wrap it in paper and swallow it, but it can be smoked.

While it can create euphoria, it can make users feel anxious and paranoid.

Some users may experience fits and heart damage.

Policing Minister Chris Philp said: ""These synthetic drugs ruin lives, families and neighbourhoods. Made in labs and pumped into our communities, our drug laws must keep pace with their evolution.""

By making monkey dust a Class A substance, criminals caught supplying it would face a life sentence.

Possession would carry a penalty of up to seven years in prison.

The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs will give the government the findings of its review in due course.

The BBC's political reporter in Staffordshire, Amara Sophia Elahi, said: ""I covered the problems the substance was causing in Stoke-on-Trent for BBC News, and five years on it is still a huge issue for the city. In fact, Staffordshire Police now have a dedicated operation aimed at trying to disrupt the supply chain of the drug in Stoke-on-Trent.

""In recent weeks, the force has seized more than 10 kilograms of Monkey Dust worth over £100,000 which was due to be delivered to addresses in the city.

""Although Stoke-on-Trent will receive an extra £1.5 million from the government's Drugs Strategy funding over the next year to try to tackle substance misuse, for many in this city reclassification seems to be the only way to prevent Monkey Dust from wreaking further havoc yet.""

Rodrygo scored twice as Real Madrid won the Copa del Rey for the first time since 2014 after beating Osasuna in the final in Seville.

The Brazilian was on hand to fire the winner from close range after Toni Kroos' shot deflected into his path.

Osasuna, playing in only their second Copa del Rey final, had threatened an upset when Lucas Torro levelled.

Rodrygo handed Real an early lead with the fastest goal in a Spanish cup final for 17 years after 106 seconds.

Osasuna, backed by nearly 25,000 fans inside the Estadio de La Cartuja, had their chances as they chased a first major trophy in their 103-year history.

They were denied a stoppage-time equaliser when Dani Carvajal produced a last-ditch block to keep out Kike Barja's side-footed effort.

Los Rojillos, which translates as The Little Reds, had more shots on target (5) than Real (3), but Carlo Ancelotti's side were ultimately more clinical in front of goal.

Victory for Real delivers a 20th Copa del Rey title as they now turn their attention to Tuesday's Champions League semi-final first leg against Manchester City.

Osasuna fans had travelled in large numbers and painted the city of Seville red in anticipation of Saturday's final, but it could not have started any worse on the field.

Vinicius Jr, who returned to the Real starting XI as Ancelotti made five changes to the side that lost at Real Sociedad, proved to be a constant threat down the left.

The Brazilian beat his marker and got to the byline before cutting"
90,"the ball back across the face of goal for Rodrygo to convert for the opening goal.

Osasuna's task nearly became even harder when Karim Benzema forced Sergio Herrera into a smart save, but Jagoba Arrasate's side began to grow into the game and they could have equalised a minute later.

Bearing down on goal after shrugging off the challenge of Eder Militao, Abde Ezzalzouli beat Thibaut Courtois but could not guide his chipped effort on target.

The leveller did come after the break when Torro's controlled finish from outside the area against his former club sent the red half of the stadium into delirium.

Some of the enthusiasm spilled over as play was momentarily halted while stewards had to use a fire extinguisher on a loose pyrotechnic where the Osasuna fans were housed.

But Madrid always carried a threat and when Vinicius Jr burst through down the left once more and dragged the ball back from the byline, Kroos' effort came off Garcia for Rodrygo to pounce and lift into the net.

With the La Liga title seemingly heading to Barcelona, Ancelotti's side will enjoy their celebrations before turning their attention to the Champions League.

The holders will be hoping they can welcome back Luka Modric from a hamstring issue to face City in the first leg at the Bernabeu.

Authorities on the islands of Rhodes and Corfu say fires are continuing to spread due to strong winds

British tourists continue to cut short their holidays as fires burn on the Greek island of Rhodes.

More flights left Greece on Tuesday to bring holidaymakers back to the UK.

The Foreign Office updated its guidance, telling people travelling to areas that might be affected to make sure they had ""appropriate insurance"".

The Liberal Democrats have urged ministers to advise against going to Rhodes unless essential, to help with travel insurance claims.

Jet2 had nine flights scheduled to depart Rhodes on Tuesday, some of which had spare seats to accommodate extra passengers trying to leave the island.

EasyJet said extra seats were available on Wednesday's flights.

Earlier, one of the airline's pilots flying British tourists to Rhodes urged passengers at Gatwick to get off the plane before take-off.

""I don't know in what capacity you are travelling, but if you are travelling for leisure, my sincere recommendation is that it's a bad idea,"" the pilot told passengers on board.

BBC Wales correspondent Gwyn Loader, who was travelling to Rhodes to report on the wildfires, said eight passengers took the pilot up on the offer, including one young boy in tears.

On Monday morning, Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell said up to 10,000 Brits were on Rhodes in total - this number includes tourists in unaffected parts of the island.

Jet2 - which ran repatriation flights to Manchester, Leeds-Bradford, Glasgow and Stansted overnight - said ""approximately 1,000 customers"" had either been flown back to the UK or moved to hotels in unaffected areas.

EasyJet has cancelled outbound package holidays to Rhodes until Saturday, while Tui has cancelled its packages going to the south of the island until 11 August.

According to the Tui website, packages to the north of Rhodes will recommence from 29 July.

Instead of formally advising holidaymakers not to travel to the affected Greek islands, the Foreign Office said people should check with their hotel and travel operator before travelling, and explained how to sign up for emergency alerts.

Updated advice said the fires were taking place ""in populated areas on the mainland and a number of islands"" and were ""highly dangerous and unpredictable"".

The Foreign Office advised those visiting the affected areas to make sure they had ""appropriate insurance"", and directed travellers towards a number of resources they could use if they were near the wildfires.

Earlier, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said he was still planning on going holiday to Greece next week. He told Sky News he was going to Evia, one of the islands that has issued an evacuation order.

He told BBC Breakfast that Greece was ""safe"" and a ""wonderful place for those fortunate enough to go abroad to spend some time this summer"".

But the government's advice was criticised in the House of Lords by Labour's Baroness Angela Smith, who urged the government to ""rethink"" its guidance.

Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran called for a change in travel advice to ""enable the thousands of British tourists due to fly to Rhodes to safely cancel their holidays without being left out of pocket"".

Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel magazine, said many travellers would not be able to claim a refund using travel insurance without a formal government travel warning.

""There will be some cover, but it won't be great,"" Mr Boland warned. ""Insurance won't, as a rule, make allowances for 'disinclination to travel'.""

Train operator London North Eastern Railway (LNER) is offering free travel to holidaymakers returning from Rhodes and Corfu.

The company said standard travel along its east coast route would come at no cost for anyone who landed at a different airport from their home location or had to travel on a different day.

Customers should present their stamped passport and airline boarding card confirming travel from the islands within the previous 24 hours to use the service between 25 July and 7 August.

Coach company National Express is offering free travel too for those who arrive at a different UK airport than they flew out from.

In an update, fire brigade deputy chief Ioannis Artophios said the most serious fires were developing in Rhodes and in Corfu. Crete - the largest of the Greek Islands - has been put on high alert because of an extreme risk of fire.

On Tuesday afternoon, two Greek air force pilots died after a water-bombing plane crashed on the island of Evia while fighting wildfires.

They were named as 34-year-old Cdr Christos Moulas and his co-pilot, 27-year-old Pericles Stefanidis.

Rescuers at the site of the plane crash after a water drop in Karystos on the island of Evia, Greece

In the last week, more than 35,000 hectares (86,500 acres) of forest and other land has been scorched by fire in Greece, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature said.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told his cabinet the next three days ""will be difficult"" but he hoped conditions will ease from Friday.

""Let me state the obvious,"" he said. ""That in the face of what the entire planet is facing, especially the Mediterranean, which is a hotspot for climate change, there is no magic defence.

""If there was, obviously we would have implemented it.""

Could powerful heatwaves and summer wildfires, which have devastated communities and displaced tourists in Greece, become the new normal in Europe?

A child killer who murdered a seven-year-old girl in 1992 has been jailed for at least 29 years.

David Boyd, 55, lured Nikki Allan to a derelict building in Sunderland where he beat her and stabbed her 37 times.

Judge Mrs Justice Lambert said Nikki must have endured ""unimaginable fear"" in the moments before her death.

Boyd, who was eventually snared by DNA advances in 2017, was sent"
91,"enced to life after being convicted of murder earlier this month at Newcastle Crown Court.

Nikki ""knew and trusted"" Boyd but he ""took advantage of her young age and naivety"" when he ""tricked"" her into following him on the evening of 7 October 1992, the court heard.

She was last seen skipping to keep up with Boyd, who was a neighbour and her babysitter's boyfriend, as he walked towards the Old Exchange building.

Nikki Allan was lured to a derelict building where she was murdered

Boyd had a ""sinister purpose"" when he lured Nikki to wasteland outside the abandoned building and her ""fate was sealed"" when she screamed and Boyd decided to ""kill her to silence her"".

He struck Nikki in the face ""to shut her up"" then pushed her into the ""pitch black building"" where she ""must have been petrified"".

""She must have quickly known she was trapped,"" Mrs Justice Lambert said.

Nikki was attacked and killed in another room suggesting she had tried to flee her attacker.

""Her fear, as she saw you lurching towards her in the dark, is unimaginable,"" Boyd was told.

""It must have been a truly terrifying experience for this seven-year-old girl.""

Nikki would have endured ""unimaginable fear"" as Boyd pursued her inside the Old Exchange building, the judge said

Boyd hit Nikki on the head with a brick, fracturing her skull, and then repeatedly stabbed in her in the chest before dragging her down a flight of stairs and dumping her body in the basement.

The judge said Nikki's murder had ""shocked and bewildered"" the community of Hendon, in the east end of Sunderland, for 31 years and as time passed Boyd would have ""thought with some relief"" that he had ""got away with it"".

However, the science of DNA had also advanced in the decades since the murder, which allowed detectives to match samples from Nikki's clothes to her killer.

Mrs Justice Lambert said under current rules she would have jailed Boyd for a minimum of 37 years but she had to comply with the sentencing regulations in 1992 which suggested a lesser sentence, albeit one ""well in excess of 20 years"".

Boyd lured Nikki to wasteland outside the Old Exchange for a ""sexual purpose"", the court as told

Speaking after sentencing, Nikki's mother Sharon Henderson, 57, said she was ""absolutely devastated"" by the sentence which she labelled a ""disgrace"", adding Boyd should have been jailed for life without the possibility of parole.

""This is what happens to families like mine over and over again - injustice,"" she added.

In an earlier statement read to the court, Ms Henderson recalled her daughter as a ""bright and sparky child"" who had a ""beautiful smile and was loved"".

The story of Sharon Henderson and her hunt for her daughter's killer.

She was 25 when Nikki was murdered and was ""accused of being a bad mother"" with ""local people angry towards me and not towards the person responsible"".

She said Boyd ""destroyed"" her family's lives but she had ""fought tirelessly and endlessly"" for justice.

Ms Henderson said she had suffered mentally and physically and ""at times targeted those who I believed were covering for others"" which led to her own arrest.

She said: ""I felt so frustrated over the years, as I felt I had not been listened to.""

Sharon Henderson (left, with Nikki's sister Stacey) told the judge Boyd had ""destroyed"" her family's lives

Nikki's father, David Allan, said he was 28 when Nikki was murdered and ""from that night my life changed"".

In a statement, he said he felt ""anger and hatred"" towards the killer and would ""never be able to forgive the man responsible"".

Mr Allan said the ""devastation"" he felt was ""indescribable"" because Boyd had ""lived his life for 30 years whilst Nikki did not get to live hers"".

Northumbria Police initially charged another of Nikki's neighbours, George Heron, with her murder but a judge presiding over the then 24-year-old's trial in Leeds in 1993 said the detectives' questioning had been ""oppressive"" and he was cleared.

After the case, he said: ""Finding out about the current investigation has been difficult - so many details and negative memories; bringing up mixed emotions about what happened back in 1992 and since.

""I feel sadness, disgust, anger, betrayal by people I expected to tell the truth (especially the original investigating officers).""

Following Boyd's conviction, the force apologised to Mr Heron and to Ms Henderson, although she rejected their words as ""hollow"".

She has called for a public inquiry into the force's ""historic failures"" in her daughter's case, and has been backed by the legal charity Centre for Women's Justice.

Nikki's family lived in the same block of tenement flats as Boyd which was just a few hundred yards from the murder scene

Prosecutor Richard Wright KC said the 1992 investigation was ""utterly misconceived"" and made multiple errors, but the team who re-opened ""the troubled and challenging"" case started from scratch with ""no assumptions"".

Police collected DNA samples from more than 800 men from around the country, took 1,200 statements and produced 2,500 documents.

The judge commended the ""Herculean"" effort and said the DNA evidence gathered had been ""critical"" in convicting Boyd.

David Boyd admitted to having sexual fantasies about young girls

The court had heard Boyd was a neighbour of Nikki's in the Wear Garth flats, he knew how to navigate the Old Exchange building and had sexual fantasies about young girls.

He also had 22 convictions for 45 offences including sexual crimes.

In 1986, he exposed himself to a woman. He later told a psychiatrist he had been doing it since the age of 16 and ""couldn't control"" the urge.

That same year he was convicted of breaching the peace in Sacriston, County Durham, when he grabbed a 10-year-old girl in a park and tried to kiss her.

In 1997, he admitted to police he exposed himself to three teenage girls but was not charged.

Two years later he groped a nine-year-old girl in a park in Stockton and confessed to a probation officer that he had ""dirty thoughts"" and ""sexual fantasies"" about young girls.

Boyd, seen here at about the time of Nikki's murder, has a history of sexually motivated crimes

In mitigation, Jason Pitter KC, for the defence, said Boyd had a history of mental illness, learning difficulties and an IQ level ""in the bottom 2% of the population"".

However, the judge dismissed that as irrelevant because he used ""sufficient guile"" to lure Nikki away from her home and was quick to cover his tracks by conjuring a false alibi.

She said there was no guarantee Boyd would be released from prison and it would be up to the parole board to decide.

Jack Rigby was only two years old when his father was murdered outside Wool"
92,"wich Barracks

A charity has praised the young son of murdered soldier Lee Rigby after he raised more than £50,000 for the group.

Jack Rigby, 12, was two years old when his father was murdered by Islamist extremists outside Woolwich Barracks.

Jack, who now lives in Halifax, West Yorkshire, ran 26.2 miles in May for charity Scotty's Little Soldiers.

It helps children grieving the death of a parent who served in the armed forces. Founder Nikki Scott said the charity was ""really proud"" of Jack.

Mrs Scott set up the organisation a year after the death of her husband Corporal Lee Scott in Afghanistan in 2009.

She said Jack had initially hoped to raise £10,000 - £1,000 for each year since his father's death - to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Lee Rigby's death on 22 May 2013.

Mrs Scott said his efforts had helped raise awareness of the work the charity did with children and young people.

""We are really proud of Jack, he's done such an amazing positive thing at a really tough time,"" she said.

""Whenever any of our young people fundraise for us it means the world, because it means what we are doing is having a real impact that they want to give back and help others.""

The 12-year-old has raised more than £50,000 for the Scotty's Little Soldiers tri-service charity

Mrs Scott said the money would enable the charity to help more children in a similar situation.

""We are there whenever they need us, that might be respite breaks, it might be attending group events with other children or it might be one-to-one emotional support.

""A whole range to make sure they never feel alone.""

Mrs Scott said although people might assume children who lost a parent at a young age had no memory, the impact of childhood bereavement ""never goes away"".

Fusilier Rigby, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, died as a result of multiple cut and stab wounds after he was attacked in London.

He had been returning to his barracks when he was attacked by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.

Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale was jailed for a minimum of 45 years.

The chancellor has said it would be a ""terrible mistake"" to give pay rises above the rate of inflation, even though strikes are hitting the economy.

Jeremy Hunt said the impact of the junior doctors' strike on NHS patients was ""regrettable"".

But wage increases that fuelled inflation would have a ""more damaging"" impact on the UK economy, he said.

Junior doctors are calling for a 35% pay rise, to make up for 15 years of below-inflation wage rises.

There has been no breakthrough in the latest public sector strike. The government has said that junior doctors' pay demands are ""unreasonable"" and that talks can only happen if the BMA union moves ""significantly"" away from their current position.

Speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings in Washington DC, Mr Hunt said agreeing pay awards without making inflation worse was an ""incredibly difficult balancing act that we have to get right"".

Inflation, which is the rate prices rise at, is currently near a 40-year high in the UK. Prices in February were 10.4% higher than they were in the same month a year earlier.

That has prompted workers in many sectors to call for higher wages, bringing a wave of strikes. Official figures revealed industrial action held back economic growth in February.

But Mr Hunt told the BBC the government's aim was to ""put this high inflation period behind us"".

He said if the government stuck to its plans inflation could be brought below 3% by the end of the year.

""The worst possible thing that we can do for junior doctors, nurses, train drivers, teachers is to manage the economy in a way that they are still worried about 10% cost of living increases, in a year's time,"" he added.

Though the government has pledged to cut inflation, many economists have said that inflation is due to fall naturally in the coming months, as a result of energy prices falling.When asked about the junior doctors' pay demands, the chancellor pointed out that when nurses, who started out asking for a 19% rise, publicly committed to a much lower number ""that became the basis of a fruitful discussion"".

Following an IMF forecast suggesting that the UK would be one of the worst performing major economies in the world this year, Mr Hunt hit back, saying that the IMF had ""undershot on the British economy for quite a long time"".

The IMF now believed the British economy was ""on the right track"", he added, and had praised his recent Budget.

Other G7 finance ministers at the Washington gathering warmly welcomed what they saw as a remarkable change in tone and engagement from the UK, from the last set of IMF meetings, which occurred in the middle of the mini-Budget crisis, under the previous chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng.

Hail storms, heavy rain and flash flooding have battered towns across Spain, days after a heatwave.

Video recorded in the north of Spain shows icy water running through the streets, past chairs outside a cafe. The south east also saw heavy rain and strong winds.

A truck carrying 102,000 live salmon in the US state of Oregon crashed last week on a creek bed, inadvertently releasing thousands of the juvenile fish into the water.

The young Chinook, also known as King, salmon were being taken from the Lookingglass Hatchery in the state's north, to the Imnaha River, where they are listed as threatened.

But the crash caused some 77,000 fish to splash into the Lookingglass Creek, boosting the population of that waterway instead.

Wildlife officials said on Tuesday that the driver lost control around a tight turn, causing the fish tanker to roll down a rocky embankment. The driver sustained minor injuries, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) said in a statement.

The crash happened on a tight corner on 29 March, the statement says, with the 53-ft (16m) truck ""rolling onto the passenger side, skidding on its side on the pavement, and then going over a rocky embankment causing it to roll onto its roof"".

While thousands of fish made it into the water, many more were left stranded on the bank

Over 25,000 of the salmon smolts - fish that are around two years old - died either inside the truck's tanker or on the creek bank.

The local sheriff's office responded to the crash, officials said. ""Small amounts of diesel fuel were quickly contained,"" the release said, adding that there was no need for a hazardous material spill response.

The Nez Perce Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation also responded and helped by collecting and scanning transponders on the dead fish.

Salmon are anadromous, meaning they spend much of their lives in the ocean but return to freshwater rivers to spawn. Many are now raised in government-run hatcheries before being released back into their native waters to later return to those same hatcheries.

ODFW officials say the loss represents about 20% of the fish it intended to release into the Imnaha River this year.

They expect that around 500-900 fewer adult fish will return to spawn in 2026-2027 due to the loss.

The 77,000 smolts in the Lookingglass Creek will likely lead to around 350-700 additional adults returning there.

""We are thankful the ODFW employee driving the truck was not seriously injured,"" said ODFW fish hatchery coordinator Andrew Gibbs.

""This should not impact our ability to collect future brood stock or maintain full production goals in the future.""

The mausole"
93,"um features a mosaic surrounded by a raised platform, which archaeologists believe was for burials

A ""completely unique"" Roman mausoleum has been discovered by archaeologists in south London.

The remains of the structure at the Liberty of Southwark site in Borough have been described as ""extremely rare"" and feature preserved floors and walls.

Archaeologists think the site was used as some form of burial ground or tomb for wealthier members of Roman society.

Work on creating a permanent display is planned, says the team behind the find.

The discovery was made at the Liberty of Southwark excavation site

The dig was led by the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) on behalf of Landsec and Transport for London (TfL).

MOLA believes the quality of preservation makes it the most intact Roman mausoleum ever to be discovered in Britain.

Alongside the central mosaic, raised platforms were found and steps on the lowest side were still intact.

Excavators were surprised to find two layers to the site, with another similarly designed mosaic found beneath the first floor. They believe that the building was modified at some point, with the floor raised.

""All signs indicate this was a substantial building,"" says MOLA, ""perhaps two storeys high.""

A second mosaic was found beneath the first, suggesting the floor was raised at some point

While the site is believed to be a burial location, no coffins were found. However, more than 100 coins, fragments of pottery, roofing tiles and pieces of metal were discovered.

There has been a sustained period of excavation at the site, where the largest Roman mosaic found in London for over 50 years was uncovered in 2022.

Antonietta Lerz, senior archaeologist at MOLA, says the site is a ""microcosm for the changing fortunes of Roman London"" and provides ""a fascinating window"" into the life of its settlers.

The aim is to preserve the area alongside continued urban development

Archaeologists from MOLA hope to pinpoint the age of the mausoleum and have provided a three-dimensional model of the site.

Landsec and TfL say they are committed to restoring and retaining the mausoleum for permanent public display.

The new head of the probation service in England and Wales has told BBC News that more men are needed in the profession.

Kim Thornden-Edwards said it would help to bring a male perspective in some cases involving violent offenders, including cases of domestic abuse.

Its workforce has been ""stuck"" at 75% women for 30 years, she added.

She also said older people with life experiences are needed, including those who have been on probation themselves.

The probation service is responsible for supervising 240,000 former prisoners and offenders serving sentences in the community.

However, it is facing intense scrutiny after a series of men committed murders while under probation supervision, among them Damien Bendall.

He killed his partner, Terri Harris, 35, her two children, John, 13, and Lacey, 11, along with Lacey's 11-year-old friend, Connie Gent, at Terri's house at Killamarsh, Derbyshire, in September 2021.

Bendall, who raped Lacey as she lay dying, is now serving a whole-life sentence.

An independent review said probation staff had underestimated the risk Bendall posed, that they failed to carry out adequate background checks and did not display enough ""professional curiosity"".

In her first interview since taking up the role of chief probation officer in February, Thornden-Edwards told BBC's File on 4 programme that senior staff needed more options when assigning officers to cases.

""Sometimes it's really good to be able to allocate a case where they think the gender will be important,"" she said.

""It might be really good for a woman to be leading on a domestic abuse case - but also, it might be good for a man to be challenging those kind of issues around masculinity and power from a male perspective.""

Thornden-Edwards, who has spent her career in the criminal justice system after qualifying as a probation officer in 1996, said the recruitment of men was an issue the service had always been unable to crack.

She said: ""It's been suggested in the past that associations of the probation service with social work has leant it to be viewed by women as more of an attractive career than men.""

Two reports, carried out by an external company for the Ministry of Justice, support moves to broaden the mix of gender, ethnic diversity and experience in the probation service.

The findings of the unpublished research - seen by File on 4 - said the service needed to hire more ""career changers"" in their 30s, 40s and 50s, who could bring skills from different sectors.

Thornden-Edwards said that later this year, the probation service was opening a non-graduate route for trainee officers - with GCSEs the only qualifications needed.

The probation union NAPO has highlighted staff shortages and huge caseloads as the main problems facing the service.

A survey of more than 900 members, conducted by NAPO and passed to the BBC, suggested that more than a third of staff are considering quitting.

File on 4 is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 4 April and afterwards on BBC Sounds.

George Michael won a fan poll with more than one million votes

Kate Bush and George Michael are among the artists who will be inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at this year's ceremony, it has been announced.

The stars will be joined on the roll of honour by country legend Willie Nelson and singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow.

Artists are eligible to enter the hall 25 years after their first single, and rap innovator Missy Elliott makes the cut in her first year of eligibility.

Bush had been nominated three times before - in 2018, 2021 and 2022.

While she has not released new music since 2011, she has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to the use of Running Up That Hill in hit drama Stranger Things.

Kate Bush could make a rare public appearance if she accepts the honour in person

The song went viral on TikTok after the Netflix show premiered last year, ultimately going on to top the charts in the UK, 38 years after it was first released.

If the star travels to New York to accept her induction, it would mark her first public appearance since 2014. Most musicians who enter the Rock Hall attend and perform at the ceremony, although some have declined.

Bush's Hall of Fame nomination prompted some controversy, after one of the voters admitted they were not acquainted with her songs. Bush's career in the US was never as mainstream as the UK.

Speaking anonymously to Vulture about the 2023 nominees, the voter said: ""I've got to admit that I'm not too familiar with her music, so I don't know if I would vote for her. I want to make sure I know the catalogue.""

Their comment sparked an angry response from fellow singer Courtney Love, who tweeted: ""Bro! The rest of us have been LIVING KATE BUSH since 1977!""

""Too much power in the hands of IDIOTS,"" she added.

Courtney Love was incensed that Kate Bush had not been inducted to the Hall of Fame on her previous three attempts

In a later column for the Guardian, Love argued that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which was established in 1983, was guilty of marginalising female artists.

The musician noted that only nine of the 31 people on the nominations committee are women, and claimed that 90% of the voters are male.

Of the 13 artists being inducted this year, four are women - with soul legend Chaka Khan receiving the musical excellence award, which recognises artists ""whose originality and influence creating music have had a dramatic impact on music"".

Nominees who didn't make the cut this year included Cyndi Lauper, the White St"
94,"ripes, Joy Division/New Order and A Tribe Called Quest.

George Michael won a fan vote, which was counted alongside official ballots in deciding this year's inductees. The former Wham! frontman picked up 1.04 million votes, putting him just ahead of Lauper, who received 928,000 votes and Warren Zevon, on 634,000.

Michael's induction comes on the 40th anniversary of Wham's debut album, Fantastic. The milestone is also being marked by a Netflix documentary and a new greatest hits collection.

Missy Elliott is considered one of the most important rappers of all time, who changed the landscape of hip-hop with her eccentric beats and innovative rhymes.

Her hits include Supa Dupa Fly, Get Ur Freak On and Lose Control - and she has produced and written songs for others including Aaliyah, Destiny's Child and Ciara.

She was back in the UK charts last month with a guest verse on the song Fly Girl by British girl group Flo. The track itself is inspired by, and samples, Elliott's 2002 track Work It.

Missy Elliott's futuristic, alien beats changed the sound of rap, pop and R&B in the 90s and 2000s

Sheryl Crow started out as a backing singer for Michael Jackson, before breaking out as a solo artist with the classic album Tuesday Night Music Club, a record that grew out of late-night jam sessions and brought blues and country back into mainstream pop.

Other inductees this year include LA firebrands Rage Against The Machine and R&B group The Spinners (known as the Detroit Spinners in the UK) whose hits include Could It Be I'm Falling In Love and The Rubberband Man - which became a hit again in 2018 after being featured in the Marvel film Avengers: Infinity War.

Sir Elton John, who was inducted in 1994, will be joined in the Hall of Fame by his lyricist Bernie Tapuin; while DJ Kool Herc will be honoured on the 50th anniversary of hip-hop.

The musician, whose real name is Clive Campbell, is considered the originator of the genre, thanks to a back-to-school party he threw in New York in 1973.

There, he pioneered the technique of playing two copies of the same song at once, alternating between turntables to extend the instrumental portions of funk and soul records, which became the foundation stone of hip-hop.

And Willie Nelson will be recognised in his 90th birthday year for a stellar career that spans seven decades.

The country legend started out as a songwriter in the 1960s, penning hits like Patsy Cline's Crazy and Ray Price's Night Life. He later became a leading voice of the outlaw country movement, achieving commercial success with the albums Red Headed Stranger and Stardust.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony will be held at the Barclays Center in New York in November.

The chief executive of NatWest, Dame Alison Rose, is facing pressure from the government to resign.

Downing Street and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt have ""significant concerns"" over her conduct, BBC News has been told.

She has apologised for discussing the closure of Nigel Farage's account at NatWest's private banking arm Coutts with a BBC journalist, saying it was a ""serious error of judgement"".

NatWest earlier said it still had full confidence in Dame Alison at the helm.

Dame Alison's apology on Tuesday afternoon comes after the BBC apologised for its inaccurate report earlier this month which said Mr Farage's account was being closed because he no longer met the wealth threshold for Coutts, citing a source familiar with the matter.

Mr Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party and Brexiteer, first reported in early July that his account had been closed.

In her first admission that she had been involved, Dame Alison said in conversations with BBC business editor Simon Jack ""she had confirmed that Mr Farage was a Coutts customer and he had been offered a NatWest bank account"".

She said she had believed this was public knowledge.

The NatWest boss said she had not revealed any personal financial information about Mr Farage.

""In response to a general question about eligibility criteria required to bank with Coutts and NatWest I said that guidance on both was publicly available on their websites.

""In doing so, I recognise that I left Mr Jack with the impression that the decision to close Mr Farage's accounts was solely a commercial one,"" she said.

She added: ""I was wrong to respond to any question raised by the BBC about this case. I want to extend my sincere apologies to Mr Farage for the personal hurt this has caused him and I have written to him today.""

Dame Alison has also faced calls to resign from Mr Farage and several Tory MPs including former cabinet minister David Davis.

Simon Clarke, Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, tweeted that the chancellor would be right to have concerns.

""The whole issue has been a disgrace from start to finish,"" he wrote.

MP Saqib Bhatti, the Conservative Party's vice-chairman for business, earlier said: ""While it's not for politicians to determine what the company should do, her position would appear to now be untenable.""

Mr Farage has said that Coutts did not give him a reason when it decided to close his account.

But Mr Farage had obtained a document outlining his suitability as a Coutts client.

The document had concerns that he was ""xenophobic and racist"", and assessed the reputational risk of having Mr Farage as a customer.

Dame Alison said that Coutts had told her the account closure had been for commercial reasons.

She said when she spoke to the BBC's Simon Jack she had not seen the dossier obtained by Mr Farage.

Speaking before the report of concerns being expressed by Downing Street and Jeremy Hunt, the chairman of NatWest Group, Sir Howard Davies, said that ""after careful reflection"" the board members had decided the chief executive retained their ""full confidence"".

A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""We have been clear that people should be able to exercise lawful freedom of expression without the fear of having their bank accounts closed.

""The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has written to some of the UK's biggest banks to reinforce that this is a fundamental right, and we will take the action necessary to protect it.""

The Economic Secretary, Andrew Griffith, is meeting bank leaders on Wednesday to discuss the issue of account closures.

People have used the relative lull in fighting to go outside their homes

Rival factions of Sudan's military agreed to renew a three-day ceasefire, shortly before it was due to expire.

The extension - for another 72 hours - follows intensive diplomatic efforts by neighbouring countries, as well as the US, UK and UN.

But there are continuing reports of heavy fighting in the capital Khartoum.

The previous truce allowed thousands of people to attempt to flee to safety, while dozens of countries have tried to evacuate their citizens.

Almost two weeks of fighting between the army and a rival paramilitary group have left hundreds dead.

The ceasefire had been expected to end at midnight local time (22:00 GMT on Thursday).

Early on Thursday evening the Sudanese regular army agreed to an extension, and its rival the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) followed suit hours later.

South Sudan has offered to host peace talks, and the army has agreed to send representatives to the talks.

Despite the bitter past and years of conflict that led to South Sudan's separating from Sudan in 2011, the two nations now enjoy cordial relations.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was ""very actively working"" to extend the truce, adding that while imperfect it had reduced violence.

But White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre later said the situation could worsen at any moment.

Abiy Ahmed, prime minister of neighbouring Ethiopia where the Africa Union is headquartered, tweeted that he had called up both of the rival generals to urge them to settle their differences amicably.

On Friday, a Turkish military plane on"
95,"an evacuation mission was shot at as it was landing at an airport outside Khartoum. No-one was injured and the RSF denied accusations by the army that it was involved.

Meanwhile the RSF and eyewitnesses said the army had been pounding its positions in Khartoum.

The foreign minister in the former civilian government, Maryam al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, told the BBC from her home in Khartoum that despite the ceasefire, civilians were still living in fear.

""What they call a truce has nothing to do with what is happening,"" she told BBC Radio Four's World Tonight programme. ""The bombardment by the aeroplanes is taking place almost all day and night.""

Fighting has also been reported in the western Darfur region and other provinces.

At least 512 people have been killed in the fighting and almost 4,200 injured, although the real number of deaths could be much higher.

The World Health Organization said it expected there to be ""many more"" deaths due to outbreaks of disease and a lack of services.

Health officials say most hospitals in conflict areas are not functioning, and more than 60% of health facilities in Khartoum are inactive.

David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee and former British foreign secretary, said the international community was in danger of neglecting the wider crisis in Sudan in the rush to evacuate foreign nationals.

""The fact that for the last 10 days pretty much all the media coverage and the vast bulk of political attention has been on getting out thousands of people and not on the need to tend to millions of people really sticks in the gullet,"" he told the BBC.

""Of course the lives of the thousands who need to evacuate are important, but what about the 45 million who are left?

""Sudan's population has 15 million people in humanitarian need and I think part of our call today as the International Rescue Committee is to say let's not fall into that trap of thinking that once thousands are evacuated the problem is solved.""

An army statement quoted by Reuters new agency said it had taken control of most of Sudan's regions but ""the situation is a bit complicated in some parts of the capital"".

It has not been possible for the BBC to verify the army's claims.

Foreign nations, including the UK, have been urging their citizens to leave the country as soon as possible.

Speaking on Thursday evening, Ms Jean-Pierre urged Americans to depart within the next 24 hours.

Evacuations are continuing, but many foreigners are still stuck in Sudan. Some have struggled to get to the airstrip used for evacuations.

Local civilians are continuing to flee the capital, where there are problems with supplies of food, water and fuel.

The number of Sudanese fleeing the fighting in Darfur have outnumbered Chadian residents in the village of Koufroun on the other side of the border, the UN children's charity says.

Chad would not be able to sustain the influx of refugees if the situation worsened in Sudan, Unicef's Donaig Le Du told BBC Newsday.

The fighting broke out on 15 April as the result of a bitter power struggle between the regular army and RSF.

Army commander Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF chief Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, disagree about the country's proposed move to civilian rule, and in particular about the timeframe of the 100,000 strong RSF's inclusion into the army.

Both factions fear losing power in Sudan because on both sides there are men who could end up at the International Criminal Court for war crimes committed in Darfur almost 20 years ago.

NHS doctor Abdulrahman Babiker was evacuated from Sudan on Friday after initially being turned away

The UK government has told NHS doctors in Sudan they can now catch evacuation flights out of the country, in a U-turn on its previous policy.

More than 20 NHS medics were initially told they could not board flights because they were not British nationals - although they have UK work permits.

The government confirmed to the BBC that non-Britons in Sudan working for the NHS could be evacuated.

The change comes just hours before the UK's final rescue flights out of Sudan.

Fighting erupted in capital Khartoum two weeks ago due to a power struggle within the Sudan's military leadership.

A UK government spokesperson told the BBC the evacuation criteria had been extended to non-British nationals in Sudan working ""as clinicians within the NHS, and their dependents who have leave to enter the UK"".

The spokesperson added that the government was working with partners to ""maintain the ceasefire and bring an end to fighting - the single most important thing we can do to ensure the safety of British nationals and others in Sudan"".

Countries have been frantically rescuing their citizens, with the latest evacuations happening during a US-brokered ceasefire, which has not held.

On Friday evening, the US also reportedly started evacuating civilians on buses - with a convoy carrying some 300 people leaving Khartoum and heading towards the coastal city of Port Sudan, according to US media. It appears to be the first evacuation of non-diplomat Americans from Sudan.

British nationals and the NHS doctors hoping to leave Sudan had until midday local time (11:00 BST) to reach the Wadi Saeedna airfield.

They were instructed to make their own way to the airfield.

The Ministry of Defence has told the BBC flights will continue to leave Sudan until all those people who registered at the airfield before the deadline have been evacuated.

More than 1,650 people have been evacuated from Khartoum and more than 1,000 have been flown to the UK, it added.

The Foreign Office has also announced consular support in the coastal city of Port Sudan, with an office established at the Coral Hotel.

It advised British nationals to visit the team for help or call the 24-hour helpline on +441908 516 666.

The Foreign Office said the last flights marked ""the end of a successful evacuation operation"" and it was winding up evacuations due to ""declining demand for seats"".

It added that the UK has ""set up a limited consular presence at Port Sudan to signpost British nationals to available options for departure"".

Stories emerged this week of National Health Service doctors being turned away from the airport in Khartoum - and the Foreign Office repeatedly told the BBC that only British passport holders and their dependents were able to get on the flights.

They insisted anyone with a work permit was welcome in the UK, but must make their own way there.

On Friday evening, a message was circulated by the Department of Health and Social Care to NHS doctors in Sudan, telling them to make their way to Wadi Saeedna airfield, just north of the capital, for evacuation.

The text, seen by the BBC, tells any medical staff with leave to remain to bring dependents and proof of NHS employment.

The change comes after the case of Sudanese doctor Dr Abdulrahman Babiker, who was initially refused a place on a British evacuation, made headlines.

Dr Babiker landed back in the UK on Saturday after he was successfully evacuated on a flight to Cyprus which landed there on Friday evening.

He told the BBC he was ""really glad"" that the UK government had changed its guidance - but said there was ""just one day only"" for his colleagues in Sudan to make the last flights.

After he landed in Cyprus, he said he had ""mixed feelings"", saying: ""I am happy that I am finally in a safe place, away from a war and on my way back to the UK. At the same time I feel down that my family (my dad, mum, brother and sister) are still endangered by this deadly fighting in my country.

""I am thinking about them now and trying to work out what I can do to help them escape the danger zone.""

Speaking to the BBC from Stansted Airport after finally making it home"
96,", Dr Babiker thanked the journalists who highlighted the position of NHS doctors trapped in Sudan and the UK government for changing evacuation guidance, as well as colleagues for their support.

The Manchester Royal Infirmary doctor is planning to fly to the UK later and is due back at work on Tuesday.

The British Medical Association had called on the government to ""ensure all NHS doctors, and their families, including those on UK visas are evacuated"".

Those comments were echoed by Labour shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, who said if there was a reduced demand for evacuation flights while the ceasefire is ongoing, then the government should widen its criteria to include British residents trying to flee Sudan.

He added: ""It cannot be right for the government to clap for NHS doctors one day and then turn them away from evacuation flights out of a conflict zone the next.""

The UK's evacuations to the RAF base in Cyprus began last Tuesday.

Other countries have also been evacuating their citizens, and the UN refugee agency said around 33,000 refugees fled from Khartoum to refugee camps in Sudan's White Nile state.

Heavy fighting between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed at least 512 people, and injured almost 4,200.

Missiles and heavy weaponry has also damaged the country's key infrastructure, including access to clean water and the internet. Health officials say most hospitals in conflict areas are not functioning, and more than 60% of health facilities in the capital, Khartoum, are inactive.

Despite the ceasefire, fighting has not come to a halt and eyewitness have reported fighting in Khartoum, the western Darfur region and other provinces.

The truce - due to end at midnight local time on Thursday (23:00 BST) - was extended for a further 72 hours.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken - who mediated talks alongside neighbouring countries, the UK and UN - said that while the ceasefire was imperfect, it had reduced violence.

The UK Foreign Office called the evacuation effort ""the longest and largest evacuation effort of any Western country"".

The parents of missing student Jack O'Sullivan say they are living in ""hell on earth"" without him.

Catherine and Alan O'Sullivan's 23-year-old son has not been seen or heard from by his family since he went to a house party in Bristol on 2 March.

Mrs O'Sullivan said: ""I want the world to try and give me an answer to where Jack is. It's horrific.""

The family is urging anyone in the Hotwells area on that date to come forward with information.

Mr O'Sullivan was last seen at 03:15 GMT in the area of Brunel Lock Road and Brunel Way in Bristol on 2 March and his family have been searching each day since then.

Jack O'Sullivan was last seen on CCTV in the Cumberland Basin area of Bristol

Mrs O'Sullivan said it was very out of character for Jack to go missing suddenly and that his 23rd birthday on 28 March was ""horrific"" without him.

""Jack's birthday was hell on earth and this last few days it's getting harder because the answers are just not coming,"" she said.

She said when she realised Jack had not come home after the house party, she knew ""instantly"" something had happened.

""Jack had been out, he had messaged me, everything seemed fine we weren't expecting him to be that late but when we awoke at 5.25am I instantly knew there was a problem because it was so unlike Jack.

""We could only go by phone messages that we were getting on my phone from a family group chat and it was giving me a location in Hotwells as to where Jack was.

""So we go there and really nothing came to light, and here we are nearly 30 days after that moment with no further information or sighting.""

Alan and Catherine O'Sullivan have retraced their son's last known steps at different times of the day to try to work out what might have happened

She said they were ""at a loss"" as to what could have happened to him for three and a half hours between when he left the party and his last phone signal.

""There is not a lot of sense to it,"" she said.

The family has been out many times in the night searching for him and retracing his last known steps.

""It just doesn't add up. We were very shocked to see how well lit the area was in the middle of the night.

""I was expecting it to be really dark and then to think well someone could trip but it's lit up like in the middle of the day,"" Mrs O'Sullivan said.

Det Insp Jason Chidgey said Avon and Somerset Police is still trying to establish Jack's movements following the last sighting of him on CCTV.

Specialist officers have carried out ""a significant number of searches"" in the area with support from the dive team, drones and dogs.

""Public awareness is key to this case,"" Det Insp Chidgey said.

""We're trying to establish what happened and exactly where Jack might be to try and answer some of those questions that the family have.

""They're going through a very difficult time and they're suffering quite a lot.""

Jack O'Sullivan was last seen on 2 March leaving a house party in Bristol

Police have appealed for anyone who was driving in the Cumberland Basin area, or who may have dashcam footage, to make contact.

Jack O'Sullivan is described as white, about 5ft 10ins (1.7m), of slim build, with short brown hair.

He was wearing a quilted green/brown Barbour jacket over a beige woollen jumper, with navy chinos and brown leather trainers with white soles.

The chancellor has praised a Tory MP for apologising after he admitted he gave other MPs' personal phone numbers to someone on a dating app.

Jeremy Hunt said William Wragg had been ""courageous"" in telling the Times he was sorry for the ""hurt"" he had caused.

Mr Wragg told the newspaper he had been ""scared"" because the individual had ""compromising things on me"".

It follows reports at least 12 men in political circles received unsolicited messages, raising security concerns.

The men are reported to include a government minister, advisers and political journalists based at Westminster.

Some had been sent naked images, and two MPs are reported to have responded by sending images of themselves.

Mr Wragg has not been suspended as a Conservative MP and the party's whips office - in charge of party discipline - is not commenting, citing an ongoing police investigation.

However, some MPs have privately expressed surprise that Mr Wragg has not lost the Conservative whip. At least one Tory MP has contacted the whips' office to say he should be suspended from the parliamentary party.

The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Wragg, who is standing down as an MP at the general election, for comment.

A Leicestershire Police spokesperson said the force was ""investigating a report of malicious communications"" that had been made to them last month.

The Metropolitan Police said it"
97,"was in contact with Leicestershire Police and Parliament's security team, adding: ""We will assess any reports made to us accordingly.""

One former MP, who is gay, has told the BBC he was targeted by someone calling themselves ""Charlie"", who claimed - wrongly - that he had previously worked for Mr Wragg.

""The last part of that message was 'Westminster misses you…' and that was basically something that friends usually do say anyway to make me feel better,"" he added.

""I was starting to feel bad actually. I was embarrassed thinking I'm speaking to someone who knows who I am and I'm trying desperately not to come across as rude.""

The next message said: ""I've just become single so I'm hanging out with the Westminster gays.""

The former MP explained he was in a relationship, but further flirtatious messages followed. After ""Charlie"" sent an explicit image, the former MP blocked him.

BBC News has also seen similar messages sent from the same number to a political journalist.

The BBC has also spoken to a man who works for an MP, who was messaged ""out of the blue"" last autumn by someone calling themselves ""Abi"" with a female profile picture.

The staffer said they claimed to know him from work, and mentioned an event he had attended.

But he grew suspicious when he asked who they were, and they replied with information that was ""clearly wrong"".

He said he ignored them, but they continued to message him. He told the BBC he learned five or six months later that someone else had received messages from a person with the same number and similar picture.

The MP's staff member said he would be ""very surprised"" if Mr Wragg had his number, and he cannot recall ever having met him.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says Mr Wragg's future is a 'question for the Conservatives'

Speaking to reporters earlier, Mr Hunt said the reports of unsolicited messages were a ""great cause for concern"" but Mr Wragg had ""given a courageous and fulsome apology"".

He added that the reports should be a ""lesson"" to both MPs and members of the public that they need to be careful about cyber-security.

It is unclear who is behind the unsolicited messages. Some MPs have expressed concerns that a foreign power, such as China and Russia, could be involved.

Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has written to MPs telling them it would be ""unwise"" to speculate, and promising to keep them ""updated on developments"".

Mr Wragg, who is vice chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, told the Times said he had sent intimate pictures of himself to a man he met on gay dating app Grindr.

""They had compromising things on me. They wouldn't leave me alone,"" added the 36-year-old, who has been MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester since 2015.

""They would ask for people. I gave them some numbers, not all of them. I told him to stop. He's manipulated me and now I've hurt other people.

""I got chatting to a guy on an app and we exchanged pictures. We were meant to meet up for drinks, but then didn't. Then he started asking for numbers of people. I was worried because he had stuff on me. He gave me a WhatsApp number, which doesn't work now.

""I've hurt people by being weak. I was scared. I'm mortified. I'm so sorry that my weakness has caused other people hurt.""

Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker said it would be ""madness"" for Mr Wragg, a friend of his, to quit as an MP.

He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme Mr Wragg had ""been subject to a sting operation by a very clever and manipulative operator"".

He added: ""I think a lot of people may think that what Will did was misguided, and even stupid, but I also believe that there's a lot of compassion out there.

""I'm not excusing what Will has done, but I do think that he is a victim in this along with all the others.""

Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the incident was ""incredibly concerning,"" and the police investigation ""should be able to take its course"".

She declined to offer a view on whether Mr Wragg, who also chairs the Commons constitutional affairs committee, should resign, adding it was a ""question for the Conservatives"".

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey would not be drawn on whether Mr Wragg should be suspended, adding it was a question for the Tories.

He added that he did not believe any of his party's MPs had been involved in the apparent phishing incidents.

A House of Commons spokesperson said it took security ""extremely seriously"" and provided MPs and staff with ""tailored advice"" to make them aware of risks online.

""We are encouraging anyone affected who has concerns to contact the Parliamentary Security Department,"" they added.

A 15-year-old girl has died after being pulled from the sea at Cleethorpes beach, police have confirmed.

Humberside Police said the girl and a boy, also 15, were airlifted to hospital at about 19:30 BST on Saturday.

The boy received treatment but was later discharged, the force said.

Both children had been reported missing at about 14:00 BST, prompting a search that involved an HM Coastguard helicopter and RNLI lifeboat.

Flowers have been left at the scene of Saturday's tragedy

Flowers and tributes to the girl have been left at the scene.

Police said the girl would not be officially named, at the request of her family.

Det Insp Nathan Reuben said: ""Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with the family at this incredibly difficult time. We ask that they are given the time and space to process this tragic news. The family is being supported by specially trained officers.

""We are working together with all the relevant agencies, including Humberside Fire and Rescue and the coastguard, to fully understand the circumstances of the tragic accident.""

An HM Coastguard spokesperson said a lifeboat was launched at 16:00 and found the pair ""some way"" to sea.

They said it had been a very difficult day for everyone involved.

Earlier, police thanked the public for helping with the search.

The owner of British Airways has posted record half-year profits helped by higher fares and the continued rebound in travel post-pandemic.

Airline group IAG reported operating profits of €1.3bn (£1.1bn) after being boosted by a ""strong"" recovery in leisure travel.

In the same period last year it had posted a loss of €446m.

IAG chief Luis Gallego said the group was aiming to be back at pre-pandemic levels of demand by the end of year.

However, the company - which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling - said that while there was no sign of weakness in forward bookings at the moment, it was ""mindful of wider uncertainties"" that"
98,"could affect fuel prices and consumer confidence in the months ahead.

IAG said flight capacity was back to 94% of pre-pandemic levels in the first half of the year.

Fares were up by about 9.5% on average, and revenue reached €13.6bn - an increase of nearly 45% from a year earlier.

IAG said it had seen a ""strong leisure traffic recovery"", adding premium leisure demand ""continued to perform very well"".

""Customer demand remains strong across the group, particularly for leisure travel, with around 80% of passenger revenue for the third quarter already booked,"" said Mr Gallego.

""And our airlines have put in place plans to support operations during the busy summer period.""

However, IAG said that some of its operations ""are not where we would want them to be and this is affecting our overall customer service"".

It said French air traffic control strikes were affecting most of its airlines, while global supply chain issues were ""reducing aircraft availability"".

The company said British Airways was ""particularly affected"" because of its ""London exposure and complex schedule"".

US President Joe Biden is expected to give an address at Ulster University's newly opened Belfast campus on Wednesday

US President Joe Biden will give a key address at Ulster University's newly opened Belfast campus next week, it has been confirmed.

He is visiting NI and the Republic of Ireland to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.

His speech at UU's £350m campus, understood to be his sole NI engagement, will take place on Wednesday.

He is expected to leave Northern Ireland that afternoon.

Mr Biden will also attend engagements in Dublin, County Louth, and County Mayo during his four-day visit.

Announcing the Belfast speech, UU vice-chancellor and president Prof Paul Bartholomew said the university was ""looking forward to what will be a very special day in [its] history and to hosting President Biden on his first visit to Northern Ireland since becoming president"".

The university's Belfast campus, which opened last autumn, ""truly reflects the hope and promise"" of the Good Friday Agreement ""and our aspirations for a positive, prosperous, and sustainable future for everyone"", he added.

It is believed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will also be in Northern Ireland for Mr Biden's visit.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to be in Belfast for US President Joe Biden's visit

On Saturday Louth County Council confirmed Mr Biden will visit both Dundalk and Carlingford, close to the border with Northern Ireland.

Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported his visit to the Republic of Ireland may include government receptions at Farmleigh House and Dublin Castle.

It is also believed the US president will attend the Irish presidential residence, Áras an Uachtaráin, to meet Michael D Higgins.

White House spokesperson John Kirby said Mr Biden was expected to address the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) on Thursday.

He will become the fourth US president to do so, following John F Kennedy on 28 June 1963, Ronald Reagan on 4 June 1984 and Bill Clinton on 1 December 1995.

It has also been confirmed that Mr Biden will be in County Mayo on Friday, where he will speak at an event outside St Muredach's Cathedral, Ballina.

Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he was ""delighted"" Mr Biden would be visiting Ireland.

""When we spoke recently in the White House, President Biden was clear that in celebrating the Good Friday Agreement, we should be looking ahead, not backwards,"" he said.

The involvement of the United States and of Mr Biden personally had been ""essential to the peace process in Ireland"", he added.

BBC News NI understands Joe Kennedy III, the US special envoy for Northern Ireland, will accompany President Biden on his visit.

It will be his first trip to Northern Ireland since taking up the post of special envoy in December.

Mr Kennedy will stay in Northern Ireland for several days after President Biden travels to the Republic of Ireland, it is understood.

On Thursday Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Asst Ch Constable Chris Todd said the visit would require a security operation on a scale not seen in Northern Ireland since the G8 summit in 2013.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin converted a late penalty as Everton gained a vital point in their battle to avoid relegation with a draw at Europe-chasing Newcastle.

Alexander Isak gave the hosts a 15th-minute lead when he collected Harvey Barnes' ball over the visiting defence, cut inside Jarrad Branthwaite and calmly slotted past Jordan Pickford.

Dan Burn had a goal ruled out for offside and Isak had another attempt cleared off the line, before the visitors were handed a late lifeline as Paul Dummett had his arm around Ashley Young's neck and wrestled him to the ground.

Referee Tony Harrington had not given a penalty, but was advised by the video assistant referee (VAR) to watch the incident on a pitchside monitor, with the spot-kick then given.

Newcastle boss Eddie Howe had no complaints about the decision and said: ""When you look at it back, it's the height of Paul's arm around Ashley's neck that swings it.""

Meanwhile, Everton boss Sean Dyche wondered why the penalty was not awarded quicker.

""I don't know why they had to look at it 100 times. I've seen it back and it should've been given straight away,"" said Dyche, who hoped the goal would be a big confidence boost to Calvert-Lewin who had gone 23 games without scoring.

""I fancied Dom to score and I'm pleased he did. Sometimes it starts you off with a penalty and it changes the noise around him. He has been working hard and we're asking a lot of him and Beto.""

Everton stay 16th in the Premier League, but move four points clear of 18th-placed Luton Town, who play at Arsenal on Wednesday.

Despite the draw, the result still set an unwanted club record for the Toffees as this was their 13th successive Premier League match without a win.

The Toffees have now not won in the league since a 2-0 victory at Burnley on 16 December and this draw took them past their 12-game winless run in the Premier League when, under Mike Walker, they failed to win a dozen matches between August and October 1994.

Newcastle stay eighth, a point behind seventh-placed West Ham, who drew 1-1 at home to Tottenham, with the Magpies having a game in hand on the Hammers.

Depending on who wins the FA Cup, seventh may be enough to qualify for Europe which would be something for Newcastle to cling on to from a tough campaign after last year's highs that saw them finish fourth, qualify for the Champions League and reach the Carabao Cup final.

Newcastle had been buoyed with a stunning fightback on Saturday to beat West Ham from 3-1 down before winning 4-3 and they will see this as a missed opportunity to continue the feel-good factor at St James' Park.

The hosts nearly took the lead within the opening two minutes but Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford - loudly booed throughout by the home fans having played for Sunderland - made a fine save to parry Harvey Barnes' effort.

But Pickford could not do anything about Isak's strike 13 minutes later for his 19th Newcastle goal of the season. The England goalkeeper then made two excellent saves - to block Jacob Murphy's volley and then acrobatically tip over a powerful effort from Isak.

Both sides had chances in an open second half, with substitute James Garner hitting the post for Everton within six minutes of his introduction.

Newcastle thought they"
99,"had got a second goal when a quickly taken free-kick released Isak and he crossed for Burn to convert, only for the goal to be ruled out after a VAR review with Isak narrowly offside.

A failure to kill off the game proved costly as Dummett's needless foul gave Everton and Calvert-Lewin the chance to snatch a draw, which they duly took.

Since the Toffees beat Burnley just before Christmas, Sean Dyche's side have lost in the league against Tottenham, Manchester City (twice), Wolves, West Ham, Manchester United and Bournemouth and drawn with Aston Villa, Fulham, Tottenham, Crystal Palace, Brighton and now Newcastle.

Everton have only had one longer top-flight winless run - 14 games from March to September in 1937 - and will be looking to avoid an unwanted piece of history when they entertain Burnley on Saturday.

Despite the reported progress in 2023, previous few years saw an alarming rise in deforestation

Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon fell by 33.6% in the first six months of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's term compared with the same period in 2022, the government says.

Its suggests the rainforest shrank by 2,649 sq km this January-June, down from 3,988 sq km in those six months last year under President Bolsonaro.

The released government satellite data has not been independently verified.

Lula has pledged to end deforestation, or forest clearance, by 2030.

But he faces a huge challenge to achieve this target, as the area of rainforest still reported to be lost under his rule is more than three times the size of New York City.

The past few years have seen an alarming rise in deforestation.

The Amazon rainforest is a crucial buffer in the global fight against climate change.

The new satellite data was presented by Brazil's National Institute of Space Research (Inpe) on Thursday.

""We have reached a steady downward trend in deforestation of the Amazon,"" Environment Minister Marina Silva told reporters.

Inpe singled out June as the month that saw a record 41% drop in forest clearance compared with the same period last year.

Lula, who took office in January, has vowed to reverse policies of his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining in indigenous lands in the Amazon.

Earlier this year, Lula decreed six new indigenous reserves, banning mining and restricting commercial farming there.

Indigenous leaders welcomed the move - but stressed that more areas needed protection.

And while deforestation was reported to have fallen, fires were up in the statistics.

In June alone, satellite monitoring detected 3,075 fires in the Amazon - the highest number since 2007.

Many of the blazes - releasing vast amounts of carbon emissions - have been linked to the clearing of previously deforested areas.

Lula, who previously served as Brazil's president in 2003-2010, has also been pushing for the world's richest nations to pay for various initiatives aimed at saving the rainforest.

In April, research by Global Forest Watch monitoring network showed that an area of tropical forest the size of Switzerland was lost last year around the world as tree clearance surged.

It said that some 11 football pitches of forest were lost every minute in 2022, with Brazil dominating the destruction.

It suggested that a political pledge to end deforestation made by world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021 was well off track.

The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world, and 60% of it is in Brazil.

Due to the large number of trees growing there, it is often called ""the lungs of the planet"" on account of how the trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.

Police officers stand next to missile debris in Kyiv

The head of Ukraine's military intelligence has warned of a swift response to a series of Russian missile strikes on Kyiv.

Gen Kyrylo Budanov said Monday's attacks failed to intimidate people in the capital who just got on with life.

All the missiles were shot down, officials said, and there were no reports of casualties.

However flaming debris from the intercepted missiles landed in residential areas in central Kyiv.

Monday's attack followed two nights of heavy drone strikes, the latest in some 16 air attacks on the Ukrainian capital this month.

The latest was unusual because it came during the day and seemed targeted at the city centre, whereas other strikes on Kyiv in May have been at night and directed at key infrastructure or air defences on the outskirts.

Gen Budanov said he wanted to ""upset"" Russia's supporters by letting them know people in Kyiv were undeterred by the attack and had continued working after it.

""All those who tried to intimidate us, dreaming that it would have some effect, you will regret it very soon,"" he added in a statement published by Ukraine's intelligence ministry. ""Our answer will not be long.""

According to reports, only one person was injured and all missiles were destroyed by Ukrainian air defences. Russian authorities claimed all their targets had been hit.

Air raid sirens reportedly also rang out across several other Ukrainian regions.

Local military commanders in Kyiv accused Russia of changing its tactics and deliberately targeting the civilian population. It certainly appears that Moscow wants to step up its pressure on Ukraine even further ahead of any counter-offensive.

Oleksandr Scherba, ambassador-at-large at Ukraine's ministry of foreign affairs, told the BBC that the last few days had been very difficult for Kyiv residents.

""Almost every night, the skies look and sound like another Star Wars episode, but we don't feel much of Russian rockets hitting their targets here within the city area. And this is all thanks to the decent countries, decent people of the world who gave us this air defence,"" he said.

Living in the capital was anything but normal at the moment, Mr Scherba said, adding that the drone attacks and sleepless nights had become ""part of our routine"".

On Sunday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his country's air defence forces after Kyiv sustained the largest drone attack since the war began.

""You are heroes,"" said Mr Zelensky, after military commanders said most of the drones launched by Russia were brought down.

In its recent attacks, Russia - which launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 - has been using kamikaze drones as well as a range of cruise and ballistic missiles.

Analysts say Moscow is seeking to deplete and damage Ukraine's air defences ahead of its long-expected counter-offensive.

Ukraine has been planning a counter-offensive for months. But it has wanted as much time as possible to train troops and to receive military equipment from Western allies.

On Monday, in Russian region of Belgorod, the governor said that several"
100,"frontier settlements were being shelled simultaneously by Ukrainian forces.

In the meantime, Russian forces have been preparing their defences in the seized regions of south-eastern Ukraine.

Harvey Borrington died from head injuries, including a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain

A woman who killed her disabled three-year-old stepson and filmed him as he lay dying has been given a 15-year prison sentence.

Harvey Borrington died from head injuries including a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain.

Nottingham Crown Court heard Harvey was non-verbally autistic and could not tell his mother he was being abused.

His stepmother Leila Borrington was convicted of his manslaughter following a trial but acquitted of murder.

The prosecution said the 23-year-old struck Harvey several times to the head at her home in Nottinghamshire in August 2021.

She then filmed him lying unconscious on the floor and sent the video to Harvey's father, with a text saying: ""Why does this happen to me?""

She did so before she called 999 for an ambulance, and then lied to paramedics when they arrived, claiming Harvey had fallen and hit his head.

Harvey's biological mother, Katie Holroyd, cried as she told the court: ""To this day I can't bear to think of him lying on that floor with him dying and her filming him, delaying getting medical help for him.""

The video, shot on Borrington's phone, showed her taking Harvey's left arm, lifting it up and letting it drop loosely to the floor.

She then continued to film as he lay not moving on the living room floor.

Leila Borrington was convicted of manslaughter by a jury

Borrington assaulted Harvey at her home in Main Road, Jacksdale, which she shared with Harvey's father.

She inflicted the fatal injuries on 7 August 2021 and he died in hospital two days later.

The court heard Harvey was killed following a history of abuse by Borrington.

Jonas Hankin KC, prosecuting, said Harvey's age and disability made him vulnerable, which were aggravating features.

""He was severely non-verbally autistic,"" Mr Hankin said.

""His challenging behaviour demanded greater empathy and kindness from his carers. It cannot justify the defendant's offending in any way.""

Borrington told the trial she had never harmed Harvey, maintaining he had fallen off a sofa and banged his head.

However, an expert witness called by the prosecution said she believed Harvey had died as a result of ""direct blunt force trauma"", sustained after Borrington assaulted the youngster.

Sentencing Borrington, Mr Justice Nicklin told her: ""Precisely what happened to Harvey only you know, but by their verdict the jury were sure that your account of Harvey having fallen, hitting his head on the floor, was not the truth or at least not the full truth.

""The jury's verdict shows they were sure you had assaulted Harvey, causing the very serious head injuries that led to his death.""

Borrington was also convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm for previously breaking Harvey's arm, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm for an incident in which she squeezed his cheeks.

She was given a two-year prison sentence and a six-month term for these offences, to be served concurrently with her manslaughter sentence.

The judge also said she would serve two-thirds of the 15-year sentence in prison before being released on licence.

Harvey's mother described him as ""my world"" and a ""treasured grandson"" to her parents.

""To have it confirmed that Harvey before his death had been assaulted by Leila Borrington will be a life-long trauma for me, a recurring nightmare which I will never be able to wake from,"" she told the court.

She cried as she explained that her son's disability meant he could not tell her about the abuse being inflicted by his stepmother.

""He couldn't tell me he didn't want to go [to stay with Borrington],"" she said.

An NSPCC spokesperson said the case ""highlighted the vulnerability of young children and those with disabilities, who are entirely dependent on those who care for them and are at increased risk of abuse"".

Dona Parry-Jones, a senior crown prosecutor at CPS East Midlands, said Harvey had ""died at the hands of someone who should have been there to care for him and nurture him"".

Det Insp Simon Harrison, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the case had been ""disturbing and upsetting"" to work on.

""The death of any child is a tragedy, but there is something especially awful about cases of this nature,"" he said.

""As a police officer I am pleased that justice has now been done, but I am aware that no custodial sentence can adequately reflect the pain and anguish felt by Harvey's family.

""My thoughts, and the thoughts of my colleagues, remain with them today.""

The two greeted each other warmly before heading inside Number 10

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has met Benjamin Netanyahu at Downing Street as the Israeli leader faces domestic turmoil over judicial reforms.

Mr Sunak greeted Mr Netanyahu outside No 10 before talks over security and the threat from Iran.

Mr Netanyahu will also meet Home Secretary Suella Braverman on his one-day visit.

Hundreds of protesters gathered at the gates of Downing Street to demonstrate against the Israeli PM's policies.

There was a cacophony, including shouts of ""shame"" and ""traitor"", as Mr Netanyahu made the short walk from his convoy to the steps of Number 10.

A planned photo opportunity for media at the start of the talks was cancelled, and there was no joint statement.

The visit comes at a time of political turmoil in Israel, with the country gripped by months of some of the biggest demonstrations in its history.

Mr Netanyahu has defied calls to scrap a shake-up of the legal system, amid warnings the crisis is not only causing social upheaval but could harm Israel's security.

Growing numbers of military reservists are refusing to serve in protest.

Thursday saw tens of thousands of Israelis take to the streets across the country, in scenes which have been repeated weekly and escalated since the start of the year.

Downing Street said that in his meeting with Mr Netanyahu, Mr Sunak ""stressed the importance of upholding the democratic values that underpin our relationship, including in the proposed judicial reforms in Israel"".

It said the two men also discussed the war in Ukraine and Iran's ""destabilising activity"", as well as its nuclear programme. It said the leaders welcomed an agreement signed this week aimed at deepening technical, trade and security ties between the UK and Israel.

Although previous visits to the UK by Mr Netanyahu have been met with demonstrations by pro-Palestinian groups, Friday's protests - led by British and Israeli Jews, with many waving Israeli flags - were an unusual sight.

On the opposite side of the road, hundreds of protesters from the Palestine Solidarity Campaign held a demonstration against Mr Netanyahu's visit and the State of Israel, while a third, small rally was also held nearby by supporters of Mr Netanyahu.

Opponents of the Israeli prime minster say he is using the judicial reforms, which will weaken the power of the Supreme Court among other"
101,"things, to bolster himself and shield policies of his government - the most right-wing in Israel's history.

Mr Netanyahu has accused critics of disrespecting voters who gave his coalition and its reform platform a commanding win in November's elections.

Rail workers are to strike next month after the RMT union rejected the latest pay deal from train operators.

RMT members will strike on 13 May, the day of the Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool.

Train operators said they had been ""blindsided"" by the strike, and denied union claims they had changed their offer.

It follows train drivers' union Aslef calling strikes on 12 and 31 May, and on 3 June, the day of the FA Cup Final.

The offer by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train firms, was aimed at ending the long-running dispute.

But the RMT union said accepting it would mean no further strike action could take place further down the line.

There had been ongoing discussions as the union and train firms tried to reach a deal.

Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said the (RDG), which represents the train companies, had ""reneged on their original proposals and torpedoed these negotiations"".

But Steve Montgomery, chair of the RDG Group said the union was ""negotiating in bad faith, again denying their members a say on a fair pay deal, needlessly disrupting the lives of millions of our passengers, and undermining the viability of an industry critical to Britain's economy"".

Workers at 14 train operators will now go on strike for 24 hours on 13 May.

Previous strikes had been called off when it was clear a new offer from the train firms was on its way.

The union had been considering the detail of the RDG's latest proposals.

They involved one year's pay increase that was dependent on the union agreeing to go into a ""dispute resolution process"" and, the industry would say, accepting the general principle of changes to working practices.

This would be followed by a second year's pay increase dependent on those reforms being negotiated at individual operators.

But the RMT has rejected the offer because it said it would not be able to call any more strikes if it accepted the first year's 5% pay increase.

The industry argues that has always been clear.

The union is currently balloting its members for another mandate for strike action lasting a further six months.

There were no train strikes in the diary this morning. Now there are four, some of them falling on the day of major sport and music events.

Any hopes the RMT's dispute with 14 train companies was close to being solved, have now been dashed. It's very much not over - unlike the dispute with Network Rail, which saw signallers and maintenance staff accept a deal in March.

The dispute with the train operators always looked harder to resolve than Network Rail, because of the changes to working conditions involved - the strings attached, from the unions' perspective.

There's more misery for passengers on the way - hitting confidence in railway travel again - and workers will lose more pay.

Train companies' separate dispute with the train drivers' union Aslef has never looked close to a resolution, and today it announced three more strike dates.

But today's announcement from the RMT was a surprise, and makes it hard to see how their dispute goes from here.

The RMT's strikes have less impact than they did when Network Rail was involved too. But right now, it looks like there's still plenty of disruption ahead.

The government has a significant role - it holds the purse strings. It has shown no sign recently of being prepared to allow the train companies to put more money on the table.

The last rail strike on 18 March meant only 40% to 50% of trains could run as workers across 14 train operators walked out.

The ongoing dispute has affected services since June last year.

One boy is in a critical condition after the incident at Blundell's School

A 16-year-old boy has been charged with two counts of attempted murder after a violent assault at a boarding school left two students in hospital.

Police said the accused has also been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Blundell's School near Tiverton in Devon.

The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, is due to appear before magistrates in Exeter on Monday.

One of the boys who was injured is in a critical condition, police said.

The other boy remains in a stable but serious condition, both have their families with them and are being supported by officers.

One man, a member of staff at the school, also sustained injuries and was discharged from hospital on Friday, Devon and Cornwall Police said.

The school is working with police, said head teacher Bart Wielenga in a letter to parents

Supt Toby Davies said: ""Our thoughts remain with the injured boys and their families in what must be a harrowing time for them.

""My officers are continuing to support them and the wider school community.""

The area has been cordoned off for investigations and was expected to remain there for the rest of the day, he added.

He also reminded people that by law the suspect could not be identified.

""These rules are not solely for media organisations to adhere to; they also apply to members of the public and includes information posted via social media,"" he said.

""This may be seen as interfering with a live investigation and an active criminal trial, and therefore could see those who do not adhere found in contempt of court.

""We therefore remind the public that it is vital that they do not speculate on the identity of either the victims or the suspect in this case.""

Blundell's School - which has fees of £41,325 a school year for a boarder - has not commented.

Head teacher Bart Wielenga sent a letter to parents and guardians about the incident, which happened at one of the boarding houses on Friday.

He added the school was working closely with the police and urged parents and guardians not to engage in speculation or post about the incident on social media.

In a way the battle has already been won, as Presdient Emmanuel Macron has got the pension reforms bill through.

But the protesters say they'll keep going, that there may be other means to get it overturned or they hope they'll bring the government down.

However, the law is now going ahead and the government is banking on there being a certain loss of momentum as a result.

It may also be banking on the fact that if the movement radicalises, which it may well do now - as more hardline elements take over and there are outbursts of violence on the streets - then many people will turn away and say it's no longer their fight.

Florida's top court has paved the way for the state's six-week abortion ban to take effect, but is allowing voters to have their say on the issue.

The justices have upheld the state's 15-week ban on abortion, in a ruling that means a subsequently passed six-week ban can soon begin.

But the court will also let Floridians decide in November if abortion rights should be sealed in the state charter.

Most Americans back legalised abortion, but most also favour restrictions.

The abortion ballot initiative could energise liberal voters in a presidential swing state that has been trending conservative in recent election cycles.

On Monday, Florida's Republican-appointed justices decided by 6-1 that the state's constitution - specifically its privacy protections - did not apply to abortion access.

A year ago Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law a six-week abortion ban, but that bill was written so as to be placed on hold until the 15-week ban had cleared legal challenges.

Following Monday's ruling, the six-week ban can take effect within 30 days. Many women do not realise they are pregnant at six weeks.

Planned Parenthood, which runs clinics that provide abortions, and the American Civil Liberties Union were among groups that filed the lawsuit challenging the ban.

An abortion rights protest in Fort Lauderdale in 2022

In a separate ruling on Monday, the Florida Supreme Court decided 4-3 that a proposed constitutional amendment that would protect access to abortion in the state could be included on ballots this November, when the US general election is held.

The ballot question will ask Floridians to vote 'yes' or 'no' to a statement that reads: ""No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient's health."" Viability refers to when a foetus, or unborn child, might survive outside the uterus, which is usually around 24 weeks.

It adds that ""this amendment does not change the Legislature's constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion"".

The ballot question was opposed by Governor DeSantis and Florida's Attorney General Ashley Moody, also a Republican.

Ohio, Michigan and Kansas are among states that have passed ballot measures in favour of abortion rights since the US Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a longstanding nationwide right to abortion.

A constitutional amendment in Florida needs to be approved by 60% of voters - a higher threshold than in other states.

If it does pass, voters could effectively reverse both the 15-week and six-week bans on the procedure.

US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, reportedly believes Florida's abortion debate could offer a path to victory for him in that state this November.

In a memo shared with NBC News, his campaign said Florida is ""winnable"" for the president if he campaigns on the issue.

Mr Biden's Republican challenger, former US President Donald Trump, won Florida in 2016 and 2020.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa at a summit in 2019

South Africa plans to change its law so that it has the power to decide whether or not to arrest a leader wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), a deputy minister has told the BBC.

Obed Bapela's remarks come amid intense speculation over whether South Africa stands by its invitation to Russia's President Putin to visit in August.

The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Putin over the Ukraine war.

South Africa had earlier invited him to attend a summit of Brics leaders.

Russia has not said whether Mr Putin plans to attend the summit.

Meanwhile Pretoria has also granted diplomatic immunity to Russian officials attending, something that its foreign affairs department described as standard procedure.

Brics is intended to strengthen ties between the nations that make it up - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

""In June we'll be submitting the law in parliament,"" Obed Bapela, a deputy minister in the South African presidency, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme.

Through the law, South Africa ""will give itself exemptions of who to arrest and who not to arrest,"" Mr Bapela said.

Under its current laws, South Africa is obliged to arrest Mr Putin if he arrives on its shores, as it is a member of the ICC.

But South Africa has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, insisting it wants to remain neutral.

The ICC issued its warrant for Mr Putin in March, accusing him of being responsible for war crimes - though Moscow has rejected such allegations.

South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has launched a court application to compel the authorities to arrest Mr Putin should he arrive in August.

Mr Bapela said that South Africa was also writing to the ICC about a waiver.

This refers to article 98 of the Rome Statute, the treaty which established the court in 2002.

While article 27 says no-one is immune from prosecution by the ICC, article 98 appears to suggest that the ICC could not ask South Africa to arrest the Russian leader unless Russia agreed to waive Mr Putin's immunity from prosecution.

The deputy minister also lashed out at the ICC for its ""double standards"", saying the late Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically elected president, would have been disappointed by the war crimes court.

""We never thought that the ICC that we have today will be what it is. They never indicted Tony Blair, they never indicted [George W] Bush for their killings of Iraq people,"" he said, referring to the former UK and US leaders and their invasion of Iraq in 2003.

""Mandela would have said [that] the inequality, the inconsistency by the ICC, is a problem.""

Mr Bapela also pointed to past examples of exemptions of international justice, like the UK's decision not to extradite General Augusto Pinochet in 1998.

The former Chilean dictator was arrested in London at the request of a Spanish judge seeking to put him on trial for human rights abuses during his 17-year rule, but the UK government freed him after 16 months on the advice of medical experts who said he was unfit to stand trial. He died back home in 2006.

Prof Kathleen Stock is due to speak at the Oxford Union on 30 May

Universities must remain places where ""contentious views can be openly discussed"", University of Oxford academics have warned.

It comes amid a row over the invitation of gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock to take part in a debate.

There had been speculation a decision by the university's student union to split with the Oxford Union debating society was due to the invitation.

But the Oxford University Student Union said the decision was unrelated.

The letter, signed by 44 academics, and published in the Telegraph, stated the signatories represented left and right viewpoints.

It said the group ""wholeheartedly condemn"" the students' union split with the 200-year-old Oxford Union debating society.

Speaking to the BBC, one of the signatories Dr Michael Biggs, associate professor of sociology at University of Oxford, said he had signed the letter because he is a ""strong believer in academic freedom of speech"".

He said it was ""under threat"" as there was ""an emerging body of students who have learnt that anybody who has a view that is not their own is hateful and bigoted, and doesn't deserve any opportunity to speak"".

Responding to the letter, Prof Stock said she was ""very pleased to see there are still those at Oxford University who understand the value of upholding academic freedom, and are prepared to demonstrate this important value in public"".

""I hope their example will inspire others to do similar,"" she added.

In a statement, education minister Claire Coutinho said student debaters ""shouldn't be punished for encouraging the free exchange of ideas"".

She said the new Freedom of Speech Act ""will make sure that universities promote free speech"" and people who have their ""free speech rights unlawfully restricted on campus can seek redress"".

Prof Stock left her"
103,"job with the University of Sussex in 2021 after protests against her from students following the publication of a book where she questioned the idea that gender identity is more socially significant than biological sex.

After plans for her invite were unveiled last month, the Oxford University LGBTQ+ Society said it was ""dismayed"", and accused the debating union of ""disregarding the welfare of its LGBTQ+ members under the guise of free speech"".

Responding to the letter on Wednesday, the society said it stood by its statement, and said it was an ""insult"" for Oxford Union to give Prof Stock a platform.

Oxford Union has said attendees will have an ""opportunity to respectfully engage and challenge"" Prof Stock's views at the event on 30 May, as well as being able to ask questions anonymously.

It said there would be ""additional welfare resources available on the evening"", due to the sensitive nature of the event.

The Oxford Union intentionally resembles the House of Commons

The letter by academics characterised Prof Stock's views as being the belief that ""biological sex in humans is real and socially salient"" and said they are views which until recently ""would have been so commonplace as to hardly merit asserting"".

""There is no plausible and attractive ideal of academic freedom, or of free speech more generally, which would condemn their expression as outside the bounds of permissible discourse,"" it says.

It added the move by the student's union is aimed at damaging the Oxford Union debating society's business model, by banning it from freshers' fairs, which it said is an important source for recruitment of members.

The Oxford Union is a private members club that University of Oxford students and others pay to join. It is independent of the university and the student union.

It said the move is a ""a profound failure to live up to"" ideals of ""free inquiry and the disinterested pursuit of the truth by means of reasoned argument"".

In its response, the Oxford University Student Union said national press coverage ""erroneously"" conflated the opposition to Prof Stock and the decision to split with the Oxford Union.

It said the debate prior to the decision made no mention of Prof Stock or any other speaker, and was due to ""long-standing concerns"" about ""alleged bullying, sexual harassment, discrimination, and data privacy breaches"".

It added: ""[The student's union] will defend the right of people to freedom of expression, and will defend the right of people to have controversial and unpopular ideas debated as part of an integral part of university life"".

There has been ongoing tension in UK universities over freedom of speech on the issue of transgender rights.

Last month, a second attempted screening of a controversial film about gender-critical issues was cancelled due to protest at the University of Edinburgh.

The Oxford Union is celebrating its bicentennial year in 2023, and has a history of welcoming some of the world's most high-profile figures.

Its debating chamber has previously heard from a host of American presidents, and figures like Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.

It has also drawn controversy, having extended invites to the likes of far-right activist Tommy Robinson and French far-right former politician Marion Marechal-Le Pen.

Their appearances were marked by protests.

Update 5 June: This article originally described the free speech letter as having been signed by 44 academics, and this was amended with a note of correction on 27 May to say it was signed by academics and staff. On review, our original wording was correct and we have amended the article again to make clear that all of the signatories are academics.

Discount offers for households to use less electricity at peak times will return this winter as part of plans to minimise the risk of power cuts.

National Grid ESO said it expected to have sufficient capacity to meet demand but added it would be ""prudent"" to maintain the energy-saving scheme.

The network operator said the Ukraine war posed ""risks and uncertainties"" to gas supplies across Europe and Britain.

""Tight days"" on the energy grid were likely be in January, it said.

""There will be cold snaps in the winter and therefore we do expect to use our normal operational tools,"" said a spokesman for National Grid ESO, which is the electricity system operator for England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland has a separate electricity operator..

The so-called Demand Flexibility Service was launched in last November after Russia's gas supplies to Europe were disrupted following its invasion of Ukraine.

In a report looking ahead to the colder months, National Grid said it would have an average margin - which is the difference between the supply of electricity and demand for it - of 4.8 gigawatts. It said this was ""slightly higher than last winter"" and ""broadly in line with those of recent winters"".

However, its ""base case"" scenario assumes normal energy market conditions with no disruptions to supplies.

National Grid said it was taking steps to ""minimise the potential impact to electricity customers"" in Britain if supplies were disrupted again.

Alongside maintaining its energy-saving scheme for households to get discounts on bills, it said it was holding discussions about having two coal power stations on standby. The amount available to the grid if required has fallen from five in 2022 to two, with two now closed down and one other unable to be called upon.

The UK is heavily reliant on gas to produce electricity, with gas-fired power stations generating more than 40% of the country's electricity. It also imports electricity from continental Europe.

The squeeze on supplies led to household energy bills soaring as gas prices rocketed.

The government stepped in late last year to limit bills to £2,500 a year for a typical household. But, despite gas prices falling back, energy bills remain elevated.

A typical property will pay £2,074 a year for gas and electricity from July, far above winter 2021 when bills were around £1,277.

The Demand Flexibility Service offered people the chance to be paid to use less electricity during peak times when capacity on the grid was tight, but only homes with smart meters were able to take part.

Only 14 million households in England, Scotland and Wales, where the scheme was on offer, have a smart electricity meter installed.

National Grid said 1.6 million households and businesses who were customers of 31 energy suppliers participated in the scheme across 22 ""events"" last winter.

People were asked to avoid high-power activities, such as cooking or using washing machines for a one-hour period.

It said the amount of energy saved was enough to power almost 10 million homes, but it is not yet known how much money, on average, each household earned.

Individual suppliers decided how much customers received and whether the money was taken off bills, credited to accounts, or if it could be withdrawn as cash.

National Grid said consumers in the south, east and east midlands of England reduced their demand the most.

The operator is consulting energy suppliers to improve the service ahead of the winter.

This story has been updated to clarify that National Grid ESO only operates in Great Britain and that Northern Ireland has a separate electricity operator.

A review for the government has stopped short of recommending a laughing gas ban.

Nitrous oxide, sold in metal canisters, is the second most-used drug by 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK.

Heavy use can lead to a vitamin deficiency that damages nerves in the spinal cord.

But the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said nitrous oxide should not be banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

It comes after the Home Office asked the ACMD to provide advice on whether to make possession of nitrous oxide a crime.

Earlier this year, ministers had been considering a ban on possession of the drug - and on all direct sale of it to consumers - as part of a move to tackle antisocial behaviour.

The ACMD recommended the substance should not be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 19"
104,"71.

It said sanctions for the offences would be disproportionate with the level of harm associated with nitrous oxide, as well as creating ""significant burdens"" for legitimate uses of the substance.

Nitrous oxide is regularly used as an anaesthetic in medicine and dentistry, and as a gas for making whipped cream in cooking.

Currently, non-legitimate use of the substance is controlled under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, which the council said ""remains appropriate legislation"".

The Act makes production, supply and importation of nitrous oxide for inhalation illegal, but not possession.

Interventions should also included tackling non-legitimate supply of the drug, like closing down websites.

A Home Office spokesman said: ""This government is working to crack down on drug misuse in our communities, that is why we asked the ACMD to provide updated advice on nitrous oxide.

""We thank them for their report, which we will now consider.""

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak addressed laughing gas use in a speech about anti-social behaviour, in which he spoke about instances of ""nitrous oxide canisters in children's playgrounds"".

The government said it commissioned the report following what it described as a ""concerning"" rise in young people using the drug, often at festivals, house parties and outside nightclubs.

The Stradey Park Hotel in Llanelli is set to house up to 207 asylum seekers from 3 July

An MP and an opponent of plans to house hundreds of asylum seekers in a hotel have both voiced concerns about people's safety amid protests.

The Stradey Park Hotel in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, is set to house up to 207 asylum seekers from 3 July.

MP Dame Nia Griffith appealed that nobody should be hurt and said hotel staff were under ""immense stress"".

Robert Lloyd, of protest group Furnace Action Committee, said the situation was ""getting out of control"".

""We are trying to object on reasonable grounds but there are elements creeping into town which lead me to fear for people's safety,"" he said.

Mr Lloyd, who described his group's campaign as ""not racist or nimby (not in my back yard) in any way"", said he was concerned that ""commuter campaigners"" were coming into town and being ""threatening"".

""I worry that somebody's going to be hurt or even killed in all this because it's getting a little bit out of control,"" he told the BBC Radio Wales Phone-In.

""I can see particularly on social media some of the things that are being said; it's quite awful.""

Robert Lloyd said he had heard of a Christian group feeling ""threatened"" by right-wing groups in the area

Carmarthenshire council, which has said it is ""firmly against"" the Home Office plan, has confirmed the hotel will accommodate up to 207 people across 77 rooms.

On Tuesday, five boulders appeared at the entrance, with a hotel manager - who did not want to be identified - and the local authority saying they did not know who was responsible.

The Furnace Action Committee denied involvement in placing the boulders, but said it hoped it would help the hotel ""see sense"".

Dame Nia said: ""What I would really stress to people is please don't let anybody get hurt.

""Please do not make it more difficult for the staff at this time, they're under immense stress with worries about their jobs,"" she told Radio Wales Breakfast.

""People have the absolute right to express opinions and protest but think not to cause any accidents or cause any unnecessary stress on the wrong people.""

No group has yet claimed responsibility for placing the boulders

Carmarthenshire council leader Darren Price has previously said he was ""outraged"" the plan was going ahead.

""Even at this stage I call on the hotel owners, Sterling Woodrow, to reconsider their position and stop this from progressing,"" he said.

Last week, a couple from Llanelli said the plan has caused them ""stress and sleepless nights"" after paying £2,000 towards their October wedding at the hotel.

The Home Office said: ""The number of people arriving in the UK who require accommodation has reached record levels and has put our asylum system under incredible strain.

""Under normal circumstances, someone seeking asylum in the UK would stay in a hostel-style accommodation, before being provided with longer term housing.

""Due to a backlog in asylum applications waiting a decision, has led to hotels like Stradey Park to be used.""

The WRU was told about unfavourable treatment of female rugby players in a 2021 review

Concerns female rugby players in Wales may have faced ""unfavourable treatment"" were highlighted to the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) two years before sexism allegations were revealed by BBC Wales.

Extracts of the 2021 independent review have been published as part of a Senedd report that found ""systemic failures in the culture of the WRU"".

Allegations of sexism and racism were uncovered in January.

The WRU said the report had led to a ""great deal"" of change.

The previously unseen review of the Wales women's rugby game was written two years before allegations of sexism were highlighted by a BBC Wales Investigates programme in January.

It concluded the WRU was, ""facing a significant number of risks not only in respect of the women's performance programme, but as a national governing body (NGB) for rugby in Wales"".

The WRU previously resisted calls for the review to be published, including from former board member Amanda Blanc who had criticised the culture at the union.

In the aftermath of the revelations reported by BBC Wales the WRU apologised, its chief executive Steve Phillips resigned and an independent panel was appointed to look at the culture within the organisation.

Acting WRU chief executive Nigel Walker told a Senedd committee the organisation had been in ""denial"" about the ""extent of the problem""

Extracts of the 2021 review are contained within a Senedd sport committee report into the WRU.

One review conclusion titled ""legal risk"" said: ""There is the potential for individuals within the game (currently and formerly) to challenge the WRU with some worrying examples of what could be defined as unfavourable treatment and a lack of equitable provision provided through this review.""

Another conclusion titled ""reputational risk"" said: ""The perceived intransigence and reluctance to fully commit to women's performance in respect of investment, profile, culture and leadership will only serve to reinforce views of the WRU as a NGB for men's rugby with little interest in the female game.""

In evidence to the committee, the WRU acting chief executive, Nigel Walker said there were 40 recommendations in the 2021 review, and told the committee, ""it was obvious that the Welsh Rugby Union had failed women's rugby"".

The Senedd report also highlighted six reports in the past five years of sexist, racist or homophobic complaints within the WRU, with three WRU staff members being subject to disciplinary action following the allegations.

Responding to a question from the committee about non-disclosure agreements, the WRU said it had used four ""settlement agreements"" in the past five years connected to allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia.

The committee said there was ""long-standing toxic behaviour"" within the WRU and opportunities were missed to act on ""concerning behaviour"".

These included ""formal complaints, the WRU entering into several settlement agreements in relation to allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia over several years, the review into the women's game and the resignation of Amanda Blanc"".

Committee chairperson Delyth Jewell MS said evidence showed the WRU ""had seen a failure of governance"" and ""there were failures in the culture of the union that led to women feeling that they had no choice but to go to the press about what had happened to them"".

She said: ""That was utterly unacceptable, it should never have happened that way.""

Ms Jewell added that women's voices should be kept ""at the heart of our"
105,"deliberations"", so when a new review is published ""we can have complete faith"" that recommendations are actually acted upon.

The Senedd sport committee found a ""serious failure of governance"" by the WRU

The committee added: ""It is unacceptable that it took a BBC documentary for the Welsh Rugby Union to act decisively.""

Speaking to the BBC's Walescast podcast earlier this month, Henry Engelhardt, a WRU independent non-executive director and a former chief executive of Admiral Insurance described the BBC investigation as ""sensationalism"".

But soon after Mr Walker insisted the organisation, including Mr Engelhardt were ""remorseful"" about what went on in the union.

In its report the committee made several recommendations, including that any future Welsh government funding to the WRU should be compatible with a violence against women strategy.

The committee also called on the Welsh government to review how ministers and civil servants respond to concerns raised with them regarding inappropriate behaviour in organisations in Wales.

The WRU said: ""We have already accepted, and did so again at the committee session, that we have much work to do to ensure that we address our past failures and we again express our sincere remorse for the missed opportunities and failures described and offer our sincere apologies to anyone affected.

""We commissioned the independent report into the Women's performance area in 2021 to identify concerns and help us reshape our support for our international players.

""This led to a great deal of change and we are pleased to be able to report that the recommendations have been substantively delivered. We are very proud of the way in which our squad has responded to these changes and we hope that the results are clear to see.""

Rescuers in Taiwan are working to reach more than 600 stranded people, a day after the island experienced its worst earthquake in 25 years.

One survivor has recounted how tremors unleashed rockslides ""like bullets"" around the coal mine he was working at.

The 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit near the eastern county of Hualien, killing nine and injuring more than 1,000.

Some stuck in tunnels and near a national park have been rescued by helicopters, but 34 are still missing.

The official number of people trapped or stranded rose considerably - from about 100 to 660 - on Thursday as people started getting phone signal back in the mountainous regions.

Almost all are guests and staff of a remote hotel who cannot leave because of damaged roads. Officials are now trying to work out the best way to get them out.

Food supplies have been air-dropped to dozens trapped in these areas, local reports say.

""The mountain started raining rocks like bullets, we had nowhere to escape to, everyone ran beside the sandbags for cover,"" the survivor, identified by his surname Chu, told Taiwan's Central News Agency.

Three of the nine who died were hikers on a trail leading towards Taroko National Park, named after a landmark gorge, just outside Hualien.

In Hualien city, the capital of the county where the earthquake struck, relief efforts are proceeding quickly, with workers using excavators and other heavy equipment to demolish several damaged buildings.

On Thursday morning, the BBC also witnessed relief workers removing huge boulders - the size of cars - that had fallen close to railway lines so as to get normal train services running again.

They are also using large amounts of gravel and rocks to shore up a 10-storey structure known as the Uranus building, which has been leaning downwards since the quake struck - to prevent it from falling over in case of another aftershock.

Local reports said one female teacher had died in the building when she returned to rescue her cat.

The red brick Uranus building is seen leaning precariously

Hsu Chiu-yueh, who was working opposite the Uranus building when it collapsed, told the BBC: ""It was so shaky I could barely walk. I was really scared. I felt my legs were not in control anymore. Thanks to my colleagues, they dragged me so we could get out.""

""There was a lot of dust coming into our building on our way out... We [later] realised that it came from the building across the street that had partially collapsed,"" said the 50-year-old.

Another Hualien resident recounted how the quake threw her home into disarray.

""I was just getting out of bed when a clothes rack and a low cabinet fell over,"" Ocean Tsai told BBC Chinese.

""It kept getting stronger, and I started worrying about our belongings at home. Fortunately, apart from the motorcycle tipping over, the damage was minimal.""

The earthquake, which struck 18km (11mi) south of Hualien, was followed by more than 200 aftershocks, dozens of which were at least 6.5 magnitude or more, hindering search and rescue efforts. Taiwanese authorities expect there to be more aftershocks in the next few days.

Pictures show how the road outside Hualien's Qingshui tunnel - one of many winding roads that run along Hualien's rocky coastline - had simply fallen away.

Routes like Qingshui are popular among tourists because of their spectacular views from the mountains out across the Pacific Ocean. But they are also known to be treacherous, not least because of the possibility of landslides.

Further north, the capital Taipei was also shaken violently with footage showing damaged buildings and people being evacuated. Local TV stations aired clips of smashed vehicles and stores in disarray.

""The earthquake is close to land and it's shallow. It's felt all over Taiwan and offshore islands... It's the strongest in 25 years,"" Wu Chien Fu, the director of Taipei's Seismology Centre said on Wednesday.

Power cuts and internet outages were reported across the island.

The earthquake also triggered tsunami alerts earlier in the day on Wednesday in nearby Japanese and Philippine islands, but these alerts were later downgraded.

While Taiwan has a history of quakes, both locals and foreigners who have lived in Taipei for years say this is the strongest quake they have experienced in decades.

The last major quake at 7.6 magnitude hit in September 1999, killing 2,400 people and destroying 5,000 buildings.

Shifting debris could become dangerous for salvage crews above and below the water's surface.

US Army Colonel Estee Pinchasin looks out at the thousands of tonnes of twisted, broken steel and concrete jutting out from the dark waters of Maryland's Patapsco river, and delivers her assessment: an ""unforgiving mangled mess"".

""That's the best way to describe this,"" the fatigue-clad veteran says from the deck of an Army-operated salvage vessel, the Reynolds. ""It's hard to explain steel that is cantilevered, bent and smashed with so much force.""

The ""mess"" Col Pinchasin has been tasked with clearing is the tattered remnants of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, strewn around - and embedded into - the Dali, a massive 948ft (289m) cargo ship that now sits motionless under an expanse of shredded metal, with partially crushed shipping containers hanging from its sides.

The mangled mess is self-explanatory. But why unforgiving? Because, put simply, anything and everything here is a potential threat to the lives of salvage crews.

The Dali's collision with the bridge in the early hours of 26 March brought the structure down in a matter of seconds, leaving six workers dead and the ship stuck. This has prompted a huge response that has included the US Army Corps of Engineers, Navy, Coast Guard, Maryland authorities and specialist private firms.

The effort aims to unblock the 700ft (213m) wide and 50ft (15m) deep shipping channel, re-float and remove the Dali and clear whatever remains of the estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of debris from the wider Patapsco.

"
106,"""Those things are happening simultaneously,"" Col Pinchasin, the Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore district commander, told the BBC. ""But the priority is for the channel, because we need to get those people back to work and help all the businesses that are affected.""

The port is one of the busiest on the East Coast of the United States and a key regional hub for goods including steel, aluminium and agricultural equipment. It is used by car-makers including General Motors and Honda. As many as 15,000 jobs depend on it, including 8,000 directly employed there.

Sonar images taken by the US Navy show vast quantities of debris sitting underwater (highlighted in yellow)

The mission has turned the area into a hub of activity, buzzing with small US Navy sonar vessels and police boats, workers testing spark-emitting hydraulic shears, and - so far - seven huge crane barges, including the Chesapeake, a 1,000-tonne capacity crane once used by the CIA to build a ship used to recover a Soviet submarine from the bottom of the Pacific.

Piece by piece, debris will eventually be disassembled and lifted onto barges to be taken away.

""With every layer of debris they remove, they have to go back in and survey the wreckage to see if it reacted the way we thought it was going to,"" Col Pinchasin said. ""Are there any instabilities? Are they things we missed? What did we not see?""

""They need to have discipline and be very self-critical.""

The dangerous work of making these determinations has so far fallen on teams of divers who inspect both the ship and the vast, unseen debris field beneath the surface.

They are often unable to see more than a foot or two in the muddy brown waters of the Patapsco, forcing them to be guided by operators in nearby surface vessels.

Their assessments, Col Pinchasin said, are essential to ensuring that larger pieces of debris can be dismantled and removed safely.

""The pieces might be mangled, but there's a lot of force pent-up in how they're sitting right now,"" she said, gesturing at a large chunk of metal protruding from the shipping channel.

""If you were to cut one of those things, and there's tension there you don't know about and it snaps, people can be in a lot of danger,"" she added. ""We need to know what's connected, and that's why the divers have to go in. They have to feel and reach to verify… but it's like they have their eyes closed.""

A separate team of divers, drawn from the ranks of the Maryland State Police, stands ready to dive if and when investigators believe they have found the remains of the three men still missing from the collapse.

The continued search for those men, she added, continues to weigh heavily on the minds of those involved in the salvage operation.

""These are families that did not get to celebrate Easter together,"" she said. ""This is very solemn ground.""

Those involved in the operation and maritime experts say that the scope of the operation has few, if any comparisons.

An initial $60m (£47.4m) in emergency funds have been earmarked to cover the work. The true cost may be much higher, with one politician, Maryland Democrat David Trone, telling CBS that the cost could eventually rise to $1bn.

""The scale is the biggest challenge, but also the complexity,"" said Captain Dan Hoban, a British Royal Engineer who was on a routine exchange with the US Army Corps of Engineers when the bridge collapsed.

""It's a really messy situation. From an engineering perspective, we are trying to figure out where the cuts are going to be made and then incorporate that into a lifting plan,"" added Capt Hoban, who has been helping with the mission.

""But it needs to be safe for all those operating out there,"" he added. ""Everyone wants to get going quickly, but trying to do so safely and efficiently. We don't want to create a more difficult situation. That's the key.""

Large crane barges are also serving as launch pads for extensive dive operations around the Dali

Peter Ford, a long time merchant mariner whose firm SkyRock Advisors specialises in infrastructure projects, said that the ""intricacies"" of the Baltimore operation made it considerably more hazardous than other complex operations, such as that which freed the Ever Given, after it got stuck in the Suez Canal in 2021.

""This is beyond anything we've seen,"" he said. ""It's all going to be hard. It's the mixture of the infrastructure above and below water and the fact that debris is literally draped over and balancing on the vessel.""

Once salvage crews begin cutting larger pieces of the debris, Mr Ford predicts that the constant shifting and movement of the debris and the vessel alike can become a potentially dangerous challenge.

""God forbid that somebody miscalculates and this very sharp steel ends up cutting into a part of the ship where the bunker fuel is, or some sort of hazardous commodities on the vessel are breached and leaked into the ocean,"" he said.

""This is a game of Jenga you don't want to lose.""

Workers plan to use specialised cutting tools and hydraulic shears to remove parts of the Key Bridge

For now, the salvage operation is still in its early stages and is largely focused on assessing the scene and the bridge, removing smaller pieces and have so far opened smaller temporary shipping channels to allow limited maritime traffic to pass through the area.

By the end of April, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to open a limited access channel 280ft (80m) wide and 35ft (10m) deep to allow one-way traffic for barge containers and some roll-on-roll-off vessels that carry cars and equipment.

The entire, permanent channel is expected to be clear and ready for use by the end of May, the ""unified command"" responsible for the operation said in a statement on 4 April.

That target date, however, may change because of the weather or unforeseen problems with the clearance operations.

""We have to go slow to go fast. Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast,"" she said. ""This is a long haul.""

Healthcare workers care for injured patrons outside the Madrid restaurant

At least two people have died and another ten were injured after a waiter flambéed a dish, accidentally setting fire to an Italian restaurant on a busy Friday evening in Madrid.

One of the injured is in a critical condition and five others have serious injuries.

Plastic plants in the restaurant caught fire during the flambé process, and the flames rapidly spread.

The food is usually covered in spirits and set alight for dramatic effect, sometimes giving it a smoky flavour.

The fire broke out near the entrance of the Burro Canaglia restaurant, which made it harder for people to escape, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported.

The paper also reported that one of those who died was an employee.

Though the blaze was extinguished quickly, it was ""extremely intense"" and generated ""a lot of smoke,"" the Mayor of Madrid, Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.

The mayor said there had been about 30 diners and staff members in the restaurant at the time of the fire.

He warned there would have been more victims had the firefighters taken longer to attend the scene, adding that it was extinguished within 10 minutes from the first warning of the blaze.

Police have launched an investigation into the causes of the fire.

An egg-freezing cycle involves taking drugs to boost your production of eggs, which are later collected and frozen

Record numbers of women are freezing their eggs in the hope of having a family later in life, according to a new report.

More than 4,000 patients froze their eggs in 2021, compared to 2,500 in 2019, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said.

The ""dramatic rise"" could be linked to the pandemic, a charity said.

But doctors warned there needed to be more awareness of the pros and cons.

Sarah Norcross, director of the Progress Educational Trust fertility charity, said some women had considered their fertility during the lockdowns.

""Restrictions on socialising may have prompted some women to"
107,"think more about their fertile window, and decide to try to increase their reproductive choices,"" she said.

Despite the number of egg collections increasing, less women decided to donate their eggs for another woman to use, according to the report.

There were nearly 1,500 new egg donors in 2019 but this dropped to just over 1,400 in 2021.

Helen Henry donated some of her eggs at the same times as having some frozen

Helen Henry, from Thurrock in Essex, donated some of her eggs when she had hers frozen 10 years ago at the age of 34.

She was in a long-term relationship with a partner at the time, who did not want children.

""I remember having counselling explaining the reason why I wanted to freeze my eggs and being given the opportunity to donate as well. I took that option as I wasn't just doing it for myself.

""After donating I started to feel quite guilty. I wasn't sure that I had done the right thing. What if the mother of the child isn't a good one? What if the child ends up in foster care? What if it's neglected?

""Fast forward a few years, I found out that a baby girl was born in December 2011 from my donation. Finding out a child was born made those guilty feelings go away,"" she said.

Ms Henry went on to have her own children with a new partner, and never used her frozen eggs, which have now been disposed of.

""I fell pregnant naturally and quite quickly and had my first daughter at age 39 and I am currently on maternity leave again having had my son last December, aged 44,"" she said.

""This will be an ongoing conversation with my two children that they have a genetic sister out there in the world. I pray that I will see this child one day. It is one of my last wishes.""

Vicky Pattison says she feels empowered by being able to make the decision to have children when it is right for her

TV presenter and podcaster Vicky Pattison, who also lives in Essex, has just had some of her eggs frozen, after deciding she was not yet ready for children.

Three of her eggs were turned into embryos with her partner's sperm, which she was told have a 20% chance of resulting in a baby. She has also kept three as unfertilised eggs, which have a 10% chance.

She shared her feelings throughout the treatment, saying there was ""not enough genuine, honest information out there"".

Success is strongly dependent on the age of the woman at the time of freezing her eggs, the HFEA said, with higher success rates in those aged under 35.

Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Bassel Wattar said more work was needed to inform patients and support them through their fertility journey.

""Unfortunately, there is limited public awareness on the pros and cons of this treatment and how it could be best planned to optimise chances of starting a family in the future,"" he said.

Petrol and diesel in Northern Ireland is cheaper than in other parts of the UK because of competition from filling stations in the Republic of Ireland, a competition watchdog has suggested.

The UK's Competition and Markets has been investigating the operation of the UK's road fuel market.

It found that competition isn't working as well as it should be, driving up prices.

It has recommendations to help people find the cheapest prices in their area.

These include a new ""fuel finder"" scheme that would be similar to a fuel price checker provided by the NI Consumer Council which enables consumers to compare the highest, lowest and average petrol and diesel prices in each town in Northern Ireland and is updated on a weekly basis.

However, it does not indicate prices for individual filling stations.

The CMA has recommended that the government uses legislation to create an open data fuel finder scheme.

This would require retailers to share their prices on an open, real-time basis, meaning that drivers can easily compare prices in any area of the UK.

The CMA says this would ""increase incentives on retailers to compete hard on price and make it easier for consumers to identify where they are not doing so"".

It has also recommended a ""fuel monitor function"" within an appropriate public body, to monitor developments in the market, both nationally and locally.

As part of its investigation the CMA looked at the extent to which average prices vary by region, and compared them to London, which it used as a baseline.

On average, the cheapest region was Northern Ireland, where petrol was on average 2.8p per litre cheaper, and diesel 1.4p per litre cheaper than in London.

It said: ""The fact that we observe prices that are significantly lower in Northern Ireland is likely due to the fact that filling stations there are competing with filling stations across the Irish border, which are subject to a range of different competitive and fiscal dynamics.""

A senior Conservative MP has been criticised for saying Afghanistan has been ""transformed"" under the Taliban.

In a video posted from the country on Monday, former defence minister Tobias Ellwood said corruption was falling and security had ""vastly improved"".

Fellow Tory Mark Francois called the video ""bizarre"", whilst former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it was not ""welcome"".

Downing Street said it disagreed with Mr Ellwood's assessment.

But Mr Ellwood defended his comments, saying stability in the country was on a ""different level"" than during times of conflict.

In a BBC News interview, he added that it was time for the UK to establish diplomatic ties with the Taliban rather than ""shouting from afar"".

British diplomatic and embassy staff were withdrawn after the Taliban's August 2021 takeover of the country after Western troops pulled out.

Mr Ellwood, who chairs the Commons defence select committee, tweeted his video during a trip to Helmand province with a landmine clearance charity.

The Bournemouth East MP said Afghanistan was ""a country transformed,"" with solar panels starting to appear ""everywhere"" whilst the country's opium trade ""all but disappeared"".

""This war-wary nation is for the moment accepting a more authoritarian leadership in exchange for stability,"" he added, whilst calling for the West to ""re-engage"" diplomatically.

Reopening the British embassy, he added, would be a way to ""incrementally"" encourage ""progressive changes"" in areas like girls' education and rights for female workers.

However, in the Commons on Tuesday, Sir Iain said the video was ""not a very welcome statement to have made"" given the ""persecutions that have taken place in Afghanistan"".

Mr Francois, who also sits on the defence committee, said the video ""made no mention of the fact that the Taliban is still attempting to identify and kill Afghan citizens who helped our armed forces, or of the fact that young girls in Afghanistan do not even have the right to go to school"".

Mr Ellwood, whose brother was killed by Islamists in the 2002 Bali bombings, said he wanted to ensure terrorism does not ""flourish"" in Afghanistan.

Speaking to BBC News, he said he understood his comments would ""cause waves"", but he was pleased he had ""shone a light on a country that we ran away from"".

""The current strategy of us shouting from afar to try and effect the agenda in Afghanistan is not working,"" he said, adding that he was speaking an ""an individual MP"".

""We need to engage more directly"
108,", more robustly, and that can be done if we open up the [British] embassy"".

A drill rapper known as Rack5 has been jailed for seven years and nine months for firearm offences, after a dramatic chase through the streets of London.

Bodycam footage and CCTV shows the moment Ellis Heather, 23, ran away from the police in Ladbroke Grove, Notting Hill, and attempted to hide in the front garden of a residential address.

After detaining the suspect and searching the area, officers discovered a firearm nearby.

Khan Younis has been devastated by Israel's military campaign

Israel's military said on Sunday that it was reducing its numbers of soldiers from southern Gaza, leaving just one brigade in the area.

The military stressed a ""significant force"" would remain in Gaza.

""This is another stage in the war effort"", Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told the BBC.

The pull-out is being interpreted as tactical, rather than a sign the war may be moving closer to its end.

Also on Sunday, Israel and Hamas said they had both sent delegations to Cairo to join fresh ceasefire negotiations.

It is six months to the day since Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage.

Israel says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead.

More than 33,000 Gazans have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says, the majority of them civilians. Gaza is on the brink of famine, with Oxfam reporting that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day.

Lt Col Lerner said troops would rotate out because the military had completed its mission in Khan Younis.

Khan Younis has been under Israeli bombardment for months, and the city and surrounding area are largely destroyed.

Lt Col Lerner said: ""The war is not over. War can only be over when they [hostages] come home and when Hamas is gone.""

""It is a decline in the forces but there are more operations that need to be conducted. Rafah is clearly a stronghold. We need to dismantle Hamas' capabilities wherever they are.""

US National Security spokesman John Kirby said it appeared to be a ""rest and refit"" and ""not necessarily... indicative of some coming new operation for these troops"".

But later Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the troops were leaving to ""prepare for their follow-up missions"".

He said their achievements in Khan Younis were ""extremely impressive"", adding that Hamas had ceased to function as a military organisation throughout Gaza.

Israel has long warned of a planned ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering.

But international pressure for a ceasefire is mounting, and the US - Israel's closest and most powerful ally - warned earlier this week that its ongoing support for the Gaza war is dependent on ""specific, concrete steps"" to boost aid and prevent civilian deaths.

Marking six months of the war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ""one step away from victory"" but insisted there would be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages.

""The achievements of the war are considerable: we have eliminated 19 of Hamas's 24 battalions, including senior commanders,"" he said.

Israelis have been marking six months since the 7 October attacks by Hamas

Tens of thousands of Israelis rallied against Mr Netanyahu on Saturday, demanding a deal to free the hostages held in Gaza.

The rallies in Tel Aviv and other cities came hours after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the body of hostage Elad Katzir.

Organisers said the protest in Tel Aviv had drawn 100,000 people, while other counts put attendance at around 45,000.

More demonstrations took place on Sunday evening, with thousands protesting in Jerusalem.

Passengers flying into the UK faced hours of delays at airports across the country where passport e-gates were not working.

Travellers told of their anger at being stuck in queues at airports including Heathrow, Manchester and Gatwick.

The Home Office said on Saturday evening that all e-gates were now operating as normal.

The disruption, which began on Friday night, had been due to an IT issue, a source told the BBC.

All airports across the country using the technology were affected.

The e-gate system speeds up passport control by allowing some passengers to scan their own passports. It uses facial recognition to verify identity and captures the traveller's image.

People flying into the UK had to have their passports checked manually, with larger airports with e-gates most affected.

Marc Baret had been booked on a flight from Chicago to Manchester via Heathrow, but told BBC News he had changed his plans after he was left waiting for more than two hours at the London airport.

He said: ""It was absolute chaos at passport control. There were people getting really frustrated and a couple of individuals tried to jump queues, the police had to get engaged and one of the passengers fainted.""

Another passenger, arriving at Gatwick, said the situation was an ""utter joke"".

Stephen, who declined to share his second name, waited for two-and-a-half hours at Bristol airport on Saturday afternoon without any access to water.

He said: ""It was very hot, there was only one water bottle fill opportunity in the Arrivals hallways, and nothing in the immigration hall itself.

""I didn't have a water bottle to top up so was very thirsty afterwards.""

Eurostar passengers were also affected, with travellers waiting in lengthy queues at Paris Gare de Nord train station because the e-gates were not working.

Stephen S waited at passport control at Bristol Airport for two-and-a-half hours on Saturday afternoon

One man said he had to wait in the queue at Luton Airport for more than two hours earlier. Craig Pullen also told the BBC it was ""very poor"" that travellers had not been given regular updates on the problem, or told how long it would take to clear passport control.

Bobby Lane waited three hours at passport control at Luton Airport in the early hours of Saturday morning.

He praised a Bedfordshire police officer who handed out bottles of water to struggling passengers, tweeting that he had ""kept thousands in line with humour and kindness"".

A spokesperson for the airport said the mood among passengers had been ""one of patience and understanding"".

Dave Tatlow was one of 300 passengers stuck in a queue at Heathrow Airport early in the morning.

He said some passengers had overheated in the hot glass building.

""One poor elderly gentleman in his seventies travelling alone collapsed, and had to be helped by other passengers and staff.

""After that, bottles of water were distributed.""

This weekend was expected to be busy for travellers, with the bank holiday coinciding with the half-term break for many families.

Separately, travellers leaving the UK from the Port of Dover also faced issues after the French passport system failed earlier on Saturday.

That issue has now been fixed, but cars and coaches were waiting for about an hour, with about 400 lorries queuing to make the crossing.

Passengers queue for ferries at the Port of Dover in Kent on Saturday

Lucy Morton, from the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that between 60-80% of incoming passengers usually use e-gates, depending on the airport.

""There's no impact on national security,"" she added, explaining that all arrivals would have been fully checked at manned officer desks.

E-gates can be used by British citizens aged over 12 and those from the EU, as well as people from countries including Australia, Canada, the US, Japan and New Zealand.

But all entry points retain manned security desks for other passengers and those unable to use e-gates.

On Thursday and Friday,"

Four out of every 10 pupils have difficulty accessing free period products in UK schools, research shared with BBC News suggests.

Government schemes to reduce stigma and improve access have been running for several years - and many schools say these have benefited pupils.

It says 97% of secondary schools in England have ordered the free products.

But some teenagers are still feeling upset, angry and embarrassed about dealing with their period at school.

Tilly, 16, realised her period had started in the first few minutes of a crucial GCSE exam last year.

""I was sat there for two hours, leaking, in my own blood, without anything I could do. I was so uncomfortable I just couldn't concentrate,"" she said.

She and other pupils had been told tampons and pads would be available in the toilets.

But when she could not find any, Tilly spent the next two hours panicking and unable to concentrate on her exam paper, as she leaked on to her chair.

As the other pupils filed out of the exam hall, Tilly waited behind, too upset to leave, then went home early as she could not face staying at school.

""I broke down to my head of year - and he didn't give me any support,"" she says. ""He told me to be more discreet about it.""

Tilly's school, in Cardiff, said it could not comment on the incident but the accessibility of products in the school had improved in the past year.

Now in Year 11, Tilly runs a Love Your Period campaign with her sister Molly

Period-product schemes are in place across the four UK nations.

The Welsh government wants to achieve ""period dignity"" by 2027, improving access to products and reducing stigma.

Earlier this year, it committed to ensuring free period products were available at every school and college in the country.

""Guidance issued to schools states period products should be easily accessible in toilets, in a basket or free to use dispenser,"" an official said.

The Scottish government made history in 2018 by becoming the first in the world to make period products free to school, college and university students.

In England, the Period Products Scheme has been in place since 2020. And the government says its funding will continue until at least July 2024.

But in Northern Ireland, Department for Education funding to provide period products in schools has been cut by 40%.

In some schools and colleges, the Period Products Scheme is working well.

At Harlow College, in Essex, a tote bag filled with pads and tampons hangs on the back of unisex toilet cubicle doors.

Gill Atkinson, from the college's wellbeing and safeguarding team, says access to products has not only removed stigma and shame around periods, it has also helped improve attendance.

The college has spent its allocated £7,000 on products this year and is hopeful funding will continue.

""I don't think the college would be able to fund it themselves,"" Gill says.

As well as providing free tampons and sanitary pads, Gill's team distributes other products, including period underwear, which she says are increasingly popular

Staff at Portland College, in Mansfield, Notts, a residential college for young disabled people, say the Period Products Scheme has helped their students to feel comfortable talking about periods.

Speech-and-language therapist Amy Smith-Patrick says some pupils need support to use the period products, so it would not be appropriate to leave pads in toilets for students to help themselves to.

Others are non-verbal, so used to struggle to know how to ask for the products they needed.

Now, students on their period can hand in a slip at reception or in class, in exchange for products - removing communication barriers and embarrassment.

Period underwear has been a ""real positive"" for students with autism, Amy adds, as it can be more comfortable for those with sensory-processing difficulties.

In some situations, it can be hard to cater for everybody's needs.

Minnie, 13, from Sheffield, tells BBC News she feels ""very embarrassed"" she has to go to a staff office on the top floor of school if she needs products - and it would be better to have them in cubicles.

But the head teacher at Minnie's school, who BBC News has decided not to identify, says if pupils have to ask for products, staff can discreetly keep track of which students might need additional support.

Minnie says the security cameras covering the sink area in school bathrooms also make her feel uncomfortable.

But the head teacher says these are for pupils' safety.

Harlow College buys in eco-friendly period products, using funds from England's scheme

Irise International chief executive Emily Wilson says while England's scheme is an ""amazing"" policy commitment, ""we've got to get it working in schools, so that when a young person needs a product it's there, available, ideally in the toilets, in a shame-free way"".

Emily Wilson's charity is preparing for a parade in Westminster on Sunday

PHS Group supplies schools with products in England and Wales and works independently of government.

Interim findings from its 2023 Period Equality White Paper suggest students are missing school or college because period products are unavailable or too expensive.

Of the 546 13-18-year-olds surveyed who had missed school because of their period:

""Our initial results show progress has been made since the pandemic but the cost-of-living crisis is having an effect,"" head of commercial Clare Hughes says.

""It's clear many learners are relying on free period products they're accessing at school - and for the next year we will work with governments and local authorities to highlight these issues.""

A Department for Education official said: ""Since the launch of our free period-products scheme, in January 2020, 97% of secondary schools and 92% of post-16 organisations in England have ordered free period products for pupils - and we're encouraging more primary schools to sign up.

""School leaders and teachers know their pupils best and our guidance provides advice and support on ways to promote the scheme to pupils that avoids embarrassment or stigma.

""It also encourages schools to involve pupils in deciding which period products are ordered.""

My Money explores how people across the UK manage their spending in a typical week.

As prices rise, BBC News has been hearing about their ways of cutting costs and the financial choices they have to make.

Janine Marsh is a radio presenter. She was laid off work during the pandemic and has been freelancing ever since. She brings in about £2,000 per month, but her income can be irregular.

She lives with her husband - who is starting a business - and their two children. Their monthly mortgage payment is £996.00 per month. They also pay £130.00 for energy, £42.00 for water, £139.00 for council tax and £59.73 for a Sky subscription.

Janine's job situation has meant a big change for the family. She can no longer save and has to stick to a strict budget.

The kids are on school holiday, so I need to keep them entertained.

I've been taking advantage of the"
110,"Easter sales to buy things we need. I picked up 10 pairs of underpants in Asda for £4.80 for our youngest boy, saving £1.20.

We went to Sports Direct to buy outdoors shoes for the kids for £5.99.

We're eating together as a family tonight, so I bought some flowers for Mum for £6.00 at Asda. She deserves a treat because she really helped us out last week when our little boy had his tonsils and adenoids out.

Over the weekend, we spent money on an Easter trail, so we're trying to keep the costs down today.

Janine tried to keep her kids entertained during school holidays without breaking the bank

The weather was nice, so we dashed out to the park in the morning. I use vouchers, coupons and promotions for little treats like coffee, or eating out.

We needed some food from Tesco so I tied it into the day out. I spent just under £15.00 on bits for tea. I bought the kids a slice of pizza and a sausage roll for £3.55 at Greggs. My coffee was free from my O2 app so that kept me going until we got home.

My £13.49 gym membership went out today. A woman came round to buy a post box shape sorter I sold on Facebook for £3.00.

My husband took the kids to the cinema this morning because I needed time to shoot some videos. I opened The Thrifty Family blog and Tiktok account back in October to talk about the financial challenges we face. This brings in around £1,600 per month.

We had two free tickets on our Vitality Life insurance app so I paid £5.99 for one ticket and we took our own snacks in. I had my MoT today and thankfully the car gods were with me. It cost £54.00 and everything was ok. We bought the car on finance and we pay £205.00 per month. It won't be paid off for another couple of years.

I organised a trip to Grandma's for the kids today. In the past I would have probably booked a holiday somewhere, but now we've got to stick to budgets.

She kept costs down by organising outdoor activities with her sons

I managed to get my hair cut - the first time I've had chance to go since January. It cost £35.00 for a cut and blow dry. I colour it myself and spend a fiver every couple of months.

This is turning out to be an expensive week. My spending today was £35.00 plus £3.00 tip.

It was big shop day today. The Tesco delivery arrived and it cost £139.88. We pay £7.99 for a delivery saver every month which means I can track how much we spend each week and there's no temptation to load up the trolley with things we don't need. If we run out in between we go to Aldi.

It rained all day in Manchester, typical in the school holidays. I took the kids for lunch to M&S because kids eat for free. It cost £19.51.

I met some friends today. We all live in different parts of the country so Birmingham was the middle ground.

I made sandwiches for the train to save on money and took a bottle of water with me. I had an iced coffee for £3.50. My train ticket cost £36.29.

We wandered around town then headed to Dishoom for food and cocktails. We split the bill and it's was £50.50. I also had a cheeky beer in Wetherspoons for £2.69.

Today was the first day this week that we didn't spend any money.

The kids wanted a pyjama day so we watched films and ate Easter eggs. I think shared experiences are all that matters. You don't have to throw loads of money at things. Time is the nicest gift that you can give people, especially your kids.

Janine's train journey was cheaper because she bought tickets in advance

My total week's spending was £399.19 excluding my regular costs and extra income from selling things.

When you break it down day by day, it seems crazy. But this wasn't a normal week for me. When the kids are off you end up spending much more money.

I hope people realise that there are ways to still enjoy your life without having to fork out loads. Promotions, vouchers and apps can bring the price down. When you're doing it everyday it really adds up.

The campaign group says the bilingual tradition must be protected and respected

More than 50 businesses in the Bannau Brycheiniog national park have called for its English name to be reinstated.

They have formed a campaign group and said they were considering legal action.

The group argued businesses have spent decades making the area a ""well-known global hotspot for tourism"".

The park authority, which said it would stop using the Brecon Beacons name last month, said people were ""welcome to use whichever name they choose"".

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Brecon Beacons National Park will now be calling itself only by its Welsh name, Bannau Brycheiniog

The decision was aimed at promoting local culture and heritage, as part of a wider overhaul of how the park is managed.

The new campaign group - called ""Our Bannau Brycheiniog/Brecon Beacons"" - is made up of range of businesses in the fields of tourism, farming, green energy, hospitality and retail.

Helen Howarth says losing the English language name will hurt tourism

They said they were proud of operating in a bilingual nation and believed ""this tradition must be protected and respected"".

They said they were also seeking legal advice about whether they could mount a High Court challenge, which would argue the park's rebrand conflicts with the 1993 Welsh Language Act obliging public bodies in Wales to treat Welsh and English on an equal basis.

""I firmly believe that losing our identity as the Brecon Beacons National Park will be detrimental to us all and especially tourism, hospitality and trade,"" said Helen Howarth, who owns a self-catering accommodation business.

The group has penned an open letter to park bosses calling on them ""to reinstate the bilingual Bannau Brycheiniog/ Brecon Beacons National Park name and brand"".

They say a number of the campaign's signatories are part of a scheme to be official ambassadors for the park and were ""not even notified about the renaming and rebranding project before its launch on 17 April"".

Nigel Kilgallon says the name change seems like ""an act of sabotage""

Nigel Kilgallon, who runs a B&B in Brecon and is a town councillor, said the name change highlights the disconnect between the authority that runs the national park, and the local community.

""You could call it a trademark, you could call it intellectual property, you could call it a marketing tool. All these things that it could be. But it's also the home of the people that live here. Our Brecon Beacons,"" he said.

""And so to just change it, just seems like an act of sabotage. It's either that or it's just ill-thought out by the authority.

""It's what it's always known as and that bilingualism is really at the heart of what we're trying to do here.""

Owen Williams, the managing director of a digital marketing agency, said he found it difficult to understand the campaigners' argument.

The attention the national park had received through its decision in recent weeks had been ""unreal"", he claimed.

""It's been a very canny marketing strategy,"" he said.

Referring to moves in other countries such as Australia to focus on the indigenous names for iconic sites he said ""tourism doesn't drop because the Ayres Rock name is minimised and Uluru brought to the fore"".

A spokeswoman for Bannau Brycheiniog National"
111,"Park Authority said the organisation had ""decided to prioritise the Welsh name going forwards"".She added: ""The park is not asking other people or organisations to prioritise the Welsh name. This is an organisational decision and applies to all the work they do.

""Others are welcome to use whichever name they choose for the park.""

Molly-Mae Hague, pictured this year, left the Love Island villa as a finalist in 2019

Love Island star Molly-Mae Hague has said she is stepping down from her role as creative director of fast fashion brand PrettyLittleThing after less than two years to focus on being a mum.

The influencer took on the reportedly big-money role in August 2021, before giving birth earlier this year.

She said while ""everything is going incredibly"" work-wise she wanted to commit fully to raising her daughter.

The 24-year-old will continue to work as a brand ambassador for the company.

Speaking on her YouTube channel, Hague - who met her partner, boxer Tommy Fury on the ITV2 dating show - said she would ""forever have the most insane relationship"" with her ""family"" at PrettyLittleThing (PLT).

""I am still working with them and doing collections and edits, but I have actually decided to step down as my creative director role,"" she said.

""Over the last few weeks, I have realised that I'm only going to get this time once with my first-born child and I'm only going to get Bambi being four months old once and I feel like I've had to rearrange my life a little bit and lose some commitments that I did have.""

She went to say she had ""loved being the creative director of PLT more than anything"", stressing that there had been ""no drama"" and ""nothing [bad] has gone on"". It was simply that this ""amazing chapter"" of her life had ""naturally come to an end"".

""I am a mum now and I never really gave myself a maternity leave and I got straight back into work instantly because my work is my phone and showing my life is my work,"" she continued.

""The last thing I would want to be is in a role that I can't fulfil right this moment.""

Her departure comes two months after longstanding PrettyLittleThing founder Umar Kamani left the Boohoo Group brand, to pursue new opportunities.

In 2021, Hague announced she was taking a new direction by accepting a senior job with the label. ""I'm excited to be a creative director - I'm not an influencer any more and people can see that, it's become a lot more than that,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat.

""I'm basically going to eat, sleep, breathe PrettyLittleThing - although I do that anyway"".

It was a big and controversial signing at the time, with some commentators suggesting it was unfair she had walked from the Love Island villa into a hugely influential fashion job.

Hague argued she had worked hard and was passionate about the brand, one she had decided to work with despite having been offered more money to go elsewhere.

She said she had turned down an offer of £2 million to work with a high street brand, simply because she did not wear their clothes.

At the time she said she wanted to improve the inclusivity of the brand by creating clothes in sizes 4-30, as well as encouraging people to remove cosmetic fillers, if, like her, they had felt they'd made a mistake.

""I think for me it was a journey of accepting that you don't need to get all these things done to your face, you're fine the way you are,"" she said.

Hague was also criticised for her involvement with the company after PrettyLittleThing owner BooHoo was accused of paying garment workers in Leicester only £3.50 per hour following a 2020 investigation by The Sunday Times.

The following year, BooHoo said: ""We recognise the risks of poor labour practices, human rights abuses and modern slavery in complex global supply chains and we are committed to establishing robust due diligence programmes and collaborating with others from the industry, authorities and NGOs to tackle poor practices and protect those people who are most vulnerable.""

Last year, Hague had an Instagram post banned after she failed to include any mention of it being an advert.

It was the third time she had been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).

She posted a picture of her wearing a PrettyLittleThing dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story.

The ASA said it was not ""immediately clear"" that she had a commercial interest in PLT. The brand confirmed their contract expressly stated the requirement for her to include the ""£ad"" disclosure in posts.

Bridlington Coastguard Rescue Team says technicians carried the ""very friendly"" dog back up the cliff using a rescue bag

The owners of a dog which fell 160ft (49m) down a cliff on the East Yorkshire coast say it's a ""miracle"" she's still alive.

Sandra Costin was walking Button the Cockapoo in Flamborough on Thursday morning when she disappeared through a gate.

After birdwatchers spotted her running about in the cove below, a coastguard team abseiled down and rescued her.

""It's unbelievable, we can't really believe it,"" her owner said.

Mrs Costin, from Oxton in Nottinghamshire, was on holiday with husband Brian and walking Button off the lead through fields near Thornwick Bay Holiday Park at the time.

""I turned my eyes away from her for a second and it was done, as easy as that,"" Mrs Costin said.

""People started to help us, a man with binoculars looked over the edge and said, 'I can see a dog'.""

The coastguard was contacted on 999, with the what3words app used to give rescuers the cliff's location.

Button required a back operation after the fall but is now recovering at home

Mrs Costin said: ""We could see her walking around and that was such a miraculous thing, we thought she'd obviously be dead at the bottom of the cliff.

""We still don't know how she escaped because it's so far down, it's a miracle.""

Praising the team who rescued the dog, Brian Costin said: ""Everything was so organised, they abseiled down and they were there in about a minute.

""She got out of the [rescue] bag and I really couldn't believe she was alive.""

Button's owners said the dog required an operation on her back on Tuesday and was recovering at home.

Owners Sandra and Brian Costin, from Oxton in Nottinghamshire, praised both the coastguard and vets for their actions

Mrs Costin added: ""I'll never get over not having her on a lead, but when we're in fields she likes to run around and she always comes back if you shout her.""

Bridlington Coastguard Rescue Team said two technicians descended the cliff and were ""met by a very friendly dog"".

""This is an important reminder that when walking dogs on cliff top paths, ensure they are kept on a lead,"" a coastguard spokesperson said.

""Never put yourself in danger, dial 999 and ask for the coastguard.""

The blaze spread to four floors within the five-storey block of flats

About 80 people were evacuated from a block of flats after a fire spread through three floors in south London.

A witness reported seeing adults and children running from the five-storey building in Whitehorse Road, Croydon.

Ambulance crews treated one man and one woman at the scene.

Some 60 firefighters spent nearly two hours putting out the blaze, which started at 17:00 BST. London Fire Brigade said the cause was not yet known.

Two flats and two balconies on the first and second floors of the building were destroyed by fire. Most of a third-floor flat and balcony were also damaged.

Two people were treated at the scene by paramedics
"
112,"
Station commander Chris Young said: ""Around 80 people left the building, thankfully uninjured.

""Road closures are expected to be in place for a number of hours this evening and we're urging people to avoid the local area.""

The fire caused traffic queues in the area

Witness Allan Brown, 44, who lives and works in Croydon, said: ""From where I was standing, which was quite close at one point, many residents, including children, could be seen running from the building's lower floor, with some residents trying to get back into the building.

""This was before the fire department arrived with the first two engines. There were residents leaving the building and trying to get back into it, but the blaze was very high.

""We had to clear the area due [to] the smoke that filled the area.""

The LFB sent eight engines to the scene, with police and ambulance crews also responding.

The brigade said it received more than 40 calls about the fire, with crews from Croydon, Woodside, Wallington and surrounding fire stations deployed to the scene.

An LAS spokesperson said it sent an ambulance crew, an incident response officer and members of our Hazardous Area Response Team in response.

The picture of Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles was posted alongside a message

King Charles has remembered the late Queen on his first Mother's Day since her death.

A photo showing the King as a baby on the Queen's lap was released by the Royal Family on social media on Sunday.

They also shared a photo of Camilla, the Queen Consort, with her mother.

Both images were accompanied with a message wishing a special Mother's Day ""to all mothers everywhere, and to those who may be missing their mums today"".

""We are thinking of you,"" the message read.

This was the first Mother's Day since the death of the late Queen, who died on 8 September 2022 aged 96.

The Prince and Princess of Wales also posted pictures of Catherine with her three children on Sunday.

Catherine also shared memories to mark the day

In one photograph, she is pictured sitting in a tree with Prince George, 9, Princess Charlotte, 7, and Prince Louis, 4.

Another picture shows Catherine holding Prince Louis in her arms.

The photos were accompanied with a message reading: ""Happy Mother's Day from our family to yours"".

Camilla's mother, Rosalind Shand, died in 1994 from the bone disease osteoporosis aged 72. Following her mother's death, Camilla tried to help raise awareness of the condition with several visits to bone units in hospitals across the UK.

A ceremony taking place at Westminster Abbey in London on 6 May 2023 will see King Charles III crowned alongside Camilla.

The governor of the Bank of England has said it is ""crucial that we see the job through"" to slow soaring prices in a speech to the world of finance.

Andrew Bailey said reducing inflation to 2% is ""so important"" as people ""should trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value"".

Currently, inflation, which is the rate prices rise at, is 8.7% - more than four times the Bank's target of 2%.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said government would work to cut inflation.

""We will do what is necessary for as long as necessary to tackle inflation persistence and bring it back to the 2% target,"" Mr Hunt said at the start of his first Mansion House speech as chancellor.

About 400 people from the financial and business industries attended the dinner at the 18th Century building, which is the official residence of the Lord Mayor of London.

It comes at a time when businesses, as well as households, are being hit by higher costs due to inflation remaining stubbornly high in the UK.

Mr Hunt suggested companies should show restraint on profit margins, adding ""margin recovery benefits no-one if it feeds inflation"".

The Bank of England has steadily been increasing interest rates in a bid to combat inflation.

Its base rate - which has a direct effect on borrowing costs for things like mortgages and credit cards, but also influences savings rates - is now 5%, up from close to zero 18 months ago. Some analysts have predicted interest rates will peak at 6.5%, but some have said they may rise to as high as 7%.

The theory behind raising interest rates is that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money, and more worthwhile for people to save, people will spend less, which will in turn lead to price rises to slow.

Mr Bailey said in his speech to executives at the same Mansion House event ""it is crucial that we see the job through, meet our mandate to return inflation to its 2% target, and provide the environment of price stability in which the UK economy can thrive"".

He added that while the UK economy has failed to grow beyond its pre-pandemic level, there had been ""unexpected resilience"" in the face of external shocks, such as Covid and the war in Ukraine, with low levels of unemployment and avoiding a recession to date.

But the Bank of England's boss highlighted that ""tightness"" in the labour market, with many businesses struggling to find enough workers, has contributed to price inflation being ""more sticky than previously expected"".

""Both price and wage increases at current rates are not consistent with the inflation target,"" he added.

The Bank of England has previously warned big pay rises are contributing to the UK's still-high rates of inflation, but there have also been accusations that some sectors have been profiteering by overcharging customers.

Last week, the Competition and Markets Authority revealed supermarkets had sought to increase profits from selling fuel, increasing their margins by 6p per litre on average between 2019 and 2022.

The chancellor said ""delivering sound money is our number one focus"", before he delivered his speech focusing on plans for pension fund reforms.

Mr Hunt pledged the plans could provide a £1,000-a-year pensions boost to the typical earner who starts saving at 18.

While UK pension pots are the largest in Europe, worth £2.5trn, defined contribution schemes currently invest 1% in unlisted equity, limiting returns for savers and funding for businesses, the Treasury has claimed.

The chancellor revealed an agreement with leading pensions firms to put 5% of their investments into early-stage businesses in the fintech, life sciences, biotech and clean technology sectors by 2030.

The so-called ""Mansion House Compact"" has been backed by Aviva, Scottish Widows, Legal & General, Aegon, Phoenix, NEST, Mercer, M&G and Smart Pension.

Ahead of the event, Mansion House organisers said talks had taken place about security at the venue over concerns of protests. A source told the BBC the event was not disrupted.

On the night a dozen of Donald Trump's Republican rivals spoke at the same event in Iowa, only one challenged the former president head on - and he was roundly booed. It highlights the grip Mr Trump still has on his party.

Someone backstage at the Lincoln Dinner clearly had a mischievous sense of humour.

As each of the candidates hoping to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee for 2024 walked out to speak they were accompanied by a blast of music: a clip of the country song Only In America.

When it was Mr Trump's turn, two lyrics, describing two alternative paths that could await someone in the US, seemed particularly poignant:

One could end up going to prison

One just might be president

The 45th President of the United States didn't seem to mind. He doesn't try to hide from the fact that he is already facing two criminal trials and may soon be indicted in two more cases. In fact, he wears these charges as a badge of pride.

Mr Trump insists he is being unfairly targeted for purely political reasons.

He told the crowd of 1,200 Republican supporters at this dinner in Iowa - a key state because it will hold the first election in the race for the nomination next January"
113,"- that he would not have been prosecuted if he was not running for the White House again. And he would not have been prosecuted if he was not winning.

Using serious criminal charges as a mark of success takes chutzpah. But that is something Mr Trump has always had in spades. And it leaves his opponents deeply confused about how to respond.

Most simply chose to ignore Thursday evening's news that Mr Trump had been charged with three more counts in the classified documents investigation. In fact, they declined to take the opportunity to challenge the clear frontrunner in the contest at all.

One of the lesser known contenders, Will Hurd, did take a shot. The former Texas Congressman and CIA officer claimed Donald Trump was not running to make America great again.

""Donald Trump is not running for president to represent the people that voted for him in 2016 or 2020. Donald Trump is running to stay out of prison.""

Loud boos and rattling cutlery nearly drowned out the rest of what he had to say, with one man shouting ""go home"". It was clear he had lost the room.

Stacey Taiber, one of many Republican voters wearing Trump stickers, told me she did not believe any of the charges against Mr Trump. If the political establishment were ""trying so hard to get him out of the way they must be terrified he will beat Joe Biden"", she said.

Her husband, Dan, said it was President Biden and his son Hunter who should be facing criminal trials. He and many others in the ballroom repeated unproven allegations about Hunter's business dealings and claims of foreign influence (which the White House has dismissed but Republicans in Congress are investigating).

There was no fun to be had watching the different candidates interacting with each other at the dinner. They each had their own backstage suite which they popped out of to deliver their 10-minute speech. They actually didn't have to see each other at all.

Maybe there will be more fireworks when the candidates come face to face at the first Republican debate on 23 August - although Mr Trump has suggested he might skip it because he is so far ahead in the polls.

Chris Sununu, the Republican governor of New Hampshire, is no fan of the former president but recently ruled himself out of running against him in 2024.

He told me that for the other candidates to compete with Mr Trump it is not about what they say - because there are not significant policy differences - it is about how they perform.

""They need to be exciting, bring some passion, show some emotion, and they need a bit of humour and charisma.""

Who voters like and who they think can win is what matters, he added, noting that it was very hard for newcomers to the national stage to compete with the name recognition and star power of a former president.

Vivek Ramaswamy, the millennial entrepreneur and political novice, was one candidate who showed at Friday's dinner that he has the potential to break out from the crowded field of candidates currently polling in single digits.

Vivek Ramaswamy is one of a handful of candidates to make an impression

After a barnstorming performance, he got one of the few standing ovations - along with Mr Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the candidate currently sitting in second place in most surveys.

Outside the venue there was a stall selling the usual badges, T-shirts and baseball caps. Thirteen candidates appeared on stage (Chris Christie was the only official contender not to attend), but only four of them had their names on the merchandise.

Mr Trump, Mr DeSantis and Mr Ramaswamy, along with Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina who has been getting a bit of attention recently.

""I've been making my living doing this for a long time,"" the vendor told me. ""I know what sells."" And Republicans have always been strong believers in market forces after all.

Habibur Masum, 25, is wanted in connection with the fatal stabbing, police said

Police have launched a manhunt after a mother pushing her baby in a pram was fatally stabbed.

Habibur Masum, 25, is wanted over the attack in the Westgate area of Bradford at 15:21 BST on Saturday.

The 27-year-old woman, who suffered multiple stab wounds, later died in hospital.

West Yorkshire Police confirmed she was with her baby at the time of the attack and told people not to approach Mr Masum.

The force said he was known to the victim but have not confirmed their relationship.

Mr Masum is from Oldham but believed to have links to Burnley and Chester

The force also said a knife was found at the scene but it is not clear if Mr Masum is armed.

He is from the Oldham area and described as Asian and of a slim build.

Mr Masum has been pictured on CCTV wearing a duffle coat with three large horizontal lines of grey, white and black, light blue or grey tracksuit bottoms with a small black emblem on the left pocket and maroon trainers.

A witness also reported seeing him wearing a grey hoody with the hood up after the incident on Westgate's junction with Drewton Road.

Police searching the scene, at Westgate's junction with Drewton Road.

Det Ch Insp Stacey Atkinson said: ""We have had significant resources following up a number of lines of inquiry to locate Habibur Masum but at this time his whereabouts are unknown.

""I would urge anyone who does see him not to approach him but to call 999 immediately.""

He is also believed to have links to the Burnley and Chester areas.

Det Ch Insp Atkinson said the death of a young woman in ""such shocking circumstances"" has caused ""considerable concern"" in the community, adding that residents could expect to see more police officers in Bradford.

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

When the BBC's director general, Tim Davie, took over in 2020, he declared his founding principle to be ""impartiality"".

Three years later, a row over that principle and how it applies across the corporation has created a crisis that has quite clearly caught managers by surprise.

Familiar, fixed points in the weekly TV schedule unexpectedly falling off air in quick succession is proof of a crisis that has become something much bigger than a row about some tweets.

The Gary Lineker issue is more than an argument about the opinions of a highly paid sports presenter - it is a test of the BBC's fundamental values and the current director general's core mission.

The passions provoked by Lineker's political tweets and the decision to keep him off air until he and the BBC resolve this issue has poured petrol on a fire that was already well alight - the debate about the BBC's role in British politics and perceptions of bias both to the left and the right.

But first, let's look at the immediate issue.

It's worth noting that complaints about Lineker's politically charged tweets are not new.

In 2016 and 2018 the BBC defended comments made by the Match of the Day presenter about child migrants and Brexit by saying he was a freelance presenter, it was a private Twitter account and the stringent rules for journalists did not apply equally to sports presenters.

The guidelines at the time said the risk to compromising the BBC's impartiality ""is lower where an individual is expressing views publicly on an unrelated area, for example, a sports or science presenter expressing views on politics or the arts"".

Since then rules have been tightened. New guidelines on social media demanded an ""extra responsibility"" for presenters with a ""high profile"". Some described the new rule as the ""Lineker clause"".

The question is whether that rule is being fairly applied. Twitter is awash with examples of what some people think are presenters who have gone too far over recent years. Names frequently raised include Alan Sugar, Chris Packham and Andrew Neil.

In response, Mr Davie said on Saturday evening that he was in ""listening mode"" and suggested there might be an escape route by re-examining those guidelines.

There is good reason for him to want to bring this to a conclusion. Impartiality is hugely important but so too is providing a service that people pay for through their licence fee.

Match of the Day went ahead on BBC One on Saturday night - but was reduced to a 20-minute edition that did not have a presenter, pundits or any commentary - while other football coverage was dropped.

Every cancelled programme is a source of further complaint from licence payers who may not care what Lineker says on Twitter but care deeply about their favourite programmes staying on air on a Saturday night.

There is also the wider context of a government that has in recent years been critical of the BBC and its perceived liberal bias.

Greg Dyke, a former director general, who left the BBC over a clash with the Labour Government in 2004, says the decision to pull Gary Lineker from Match of the Day looks like a corporation bowing to political pressure from a Tory government.

All of which leads to another issue that asks questions of the BBC's impartiality, the BBC's chairman, Richard Sharp, a former donor to the Conservative party who is the subject of an ongoing inquiry looking in to his appointment and what he did or did not disclose about his part in the arrangement of an £800,000 loan guarantee to the former prime minister, Boris Johnson. He has denied any involvement in arranging the loan.

Lineker has become a lightning rod for a much bigger debate"
115,"and the BBC would like to resolve the issue as quickly as possible to stop a very public row turning into a monumental crisis. However, with the corporation saying it wants Lineker, with his 8.7 million Twitter followers, to stop the political tweets while he shows no sign of agreeing to be silenced, it's hard to see quite how this will resolve itself.

For the BBC this is about impartiality but to many others it is about free speech. Indeed, there is a statue outside the BBC's headquarters in London of the author of 1984, George Orwell, a former BBC talks producer. Inscribed on the wall behind the Orwell statue are these words: ""If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.""

Eighty years after Orwell left the BBC, the corporation finds itself in a deepening crisis. That thought from Orwell and the questions it raises for the BBC are at the very heart of the Lineker debate.

Israel's military said the strike on World Central Kitchen's convoy was a ""grave mistake"" and vowed to protect aid workers

Many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip will be wondering how they are going to feed their families after World Central Kitchen (WCK) paused its operations in response to the killing of seven of its aid workers in an Israeli air strike.

Another US charity it works with, Anera, has also suspended work because of the escalating risks faced by its local staff and their families.

Together, they were serving two million meals a week across the Palestinian territory, where the UN has warned that an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order.

WCK's decision to pause its work also led to the ""freezing"" of a maritime aid corridor from Cyprus, which the charity helped set up last month to increase the trickle of aid getting into the north of Gaza and avert a looming famine.

The WCK convoy was hit on Monday night as it travelled south along the Israeli-designated coastal aid route, just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food from a barge at a warehouse in Deir al-Balah.

That barge was part of a four-vessel flotilla that sailed back to Cyprus with 240 tonnes of supplies that could not be brought ashore in the wake of the strike.

The Norwegian Refugee Council warned that ""what happened to World Central Kitchen threatens the entire aid system"" and had left it ""on the brink"".

Before the strike, World Central Kitchen was providing about 350,000 meals across Gaza each day

WCK accused the Israeli military of a ""targeted attack"" on vehicles clearly marked with the charity's logo and whose movements had been co-ordinated with Israeli authorities. The victims were British, Polish, Australian and Palestinian, and also included a dual US-Canadian citizen.

The military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, described the strike as a ""grave mistake"" that had followed ""misidentification at night"".

He also vowed to take ""immediate action"" to ensure that more was done to protect aid workers, including the immediate establishment of a new ""humanitarian command centre"" to improve co-ordination. ""Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza,"" he stressed.

However, aid groups say they are not sure such promises will lead to meaningful changes. They also assert that this was not an isolated incident, with 196 Palestinian aid workers reportedly killed since the war began in October.

Jan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former UN humanitarian chief, told the BBC that WCK was ""among those who have the closest co-operation with the Israelis"", in terms of sharing information about their workers' locations and planned movements.

Before the strike, WCK was playing an increasingly prominent and important role in Gaza, with 400 Palestinian staff and 3,000 people working indirectly for it in its 68 community kitchens and distribution system.

WCK has provided 12% of the 193,000 tonnes of aid from international organisations that had reached Gaza since October, according to data from Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body tasked with co-ordinating deliveries. However, UN agencies were responsible for 80% of the total.

WCK's founder, the chef José Andrés, told Reuters news agency on Wednesday that it was ""analysing the situation and how to keep doing the work we do"".

Anera - which was providing 150,000 meals a day in collaboration with WCK - said it understood the consequences pausing its own work would have on Palestinians, but that its Palestinian staff had for the first time deemed the risk to their safety and that of their families ""intolerable"".

It said the charity's logistics co-ordinator and his son had been killed in an Israeli air strike in Deir al-Balah in March, despite the fact that the co-ordinates of the shelter where they were staying had been provided to the Israeli military.

""We've asked for explanation as to why that site was struck and we've received none,"" Derek Madsen of Anera told the BBC. ""These sites are known and so I think it is very difficult for us to understand how these strikes happen.""

Project Hope, another US-based organisation, paused its work for three days in solidarity with WCK and to ""reassess the security situation as we prioritise our staff members' safety"".

Arlan Fuller, director of emergency preparedness and response, said in a statement sent to the BBC that its employees were deeply concerned by the deaths of the WCK team, and that the strike has raised significant doubts about the effectiveness of co-ordination with the Israeli military.

For the people of Gaza, the suspension of WCK's operations ""means more famine, more dead children, more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished"", Mr Egeland warned.

At least 27 children are reported to have died as a result of malnutrition since October, according to the World Health Organization.

Mr Egeland urged Israel to start by opening the Karni and Erez border crossings with northern Gaza to allow aid convoys to drive there directly.

Most aid convoys are currently forced to start at the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossings with the south of Gaza and then pass through what the UN calls ""high-risk areas"", mainly due to shooting and shelling or the breakdown in civil order.

Cogat says Israeli forces have co-ordinated the entry of more than 500 lorries into the north over the past two months via those routes as well as a new gate and military road that runs south of Gaza City.

Israel has also facilitated the now-suspended maritime corridor set up by WCK as well as airdrops of aid by Western and Arab countries. The UN says both are helpful but cannot replace the large-scale delivery of aid by land.

The first WCK aid ship was carrying 200 tonnes of aid and took several days to reach Gaza. By comparison, a lorry can carry about 20 tonnes and the nearest Israeli container port is only a 40km drive from northern Gaza.

A C-130 transport plane meanwhile has a maximum payload of 21 tonnes, but only about 40 airdrops have taken place so far and they are considered expensive, ineffective and dangerous for people on the ground.

The UN says 159 lorry loads of aid crossed into Gaza by land each day on average between 1 and 28 March, and that the pre-war average was 500 lorry loads, including fuel.

Cogat says the pre-war average only included 70 food lorries and that 140 entered each day during March. It insists there is no limit to the amount of food and other humanitarian aid that can enter Gaza and accuses UN agencies of failing to distribute aid effectively.

The Open Arms. a Spanish charity vessel, returned to Cyprus on Wednesday after the maritime aid route was suspended

There was no apparent drop-off in aid crossing into Gaza following the strike on the WCK convoy, with 217 lorries transferred via Israel and Egypt on Wednesday and 179 food packages being airdropped"
116,", according to Cogat.

But Nate Mook, who was chief executive of WCK until 2022, warned that the longer-term consequences could be ""devastating"" for Gazans because ""we probably have not seen the last of the aid organisations to pull out"".

Zawar Ali of International Medical Corps told the BBC that it was reconsidering its safety protocols and whether to restrict its workers' movements.

It had already decided to relocate its field hospital from the north of Rafah to al-Mawasi, an area to the west which the Israeli military has declared ""humanitarian zone"" but has still carried out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets.

Dr Bashar Murad, the executive director of the Palestinian Red Crescent, said many of its paramedics were refusing to evacuate wounded and sick people from the north to the south in their ambulances due to the lack of safety guarantees, despite their protection under international law and co-ordination efforts by international organisations.

Aseel Baidoun of Medical Aid for Palestinians said it had not suspended operations after a strike in January damaged a residential compound in al-Mawasi that housed the British charity's local team and their families, injuring several people. But now, she added: ""We really are scared of the security [situation].""

""If a foreigner with international immunity is bombed and killed, then what will they do to us?"" Mohammed Aborjela, a Palestinian online content creator who launched the Youth of Gaza initiative to deliver aid after the war began, told BBC.

He said Palestinian aid workers faced higher risks and greater challenges than their international colleagues, but insisted it would not stop him and his colleagues continuing their work. ""The danger of not providing aid is no less important than the danger of being killed,"" he added.

Natalia Anguera of Action Against Hunger also said it would try to continue working despite ""more and more challenging"" conditions.

""Most of our staff are... Palestinians. They are suffering themselves, but they also have a very strong and clear commitment to their humanitarian mandate. They want to go on delivering,"" she told the BBC.

She said the international community needed to push strongly for a humanitarian ceasefire because it was the only way that aid organisations would be able to scale up their response to the level required.

Mr Egeland also stressed the importance of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which he said was ""bigger than the rest of us combined"" but was being ""systematically undermined by Israel"".

Israel accuses UNRWA of supporting Hamas, which triggered the war when its gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year. The agency has denied this, but in January it sacked nine of the 12 employees accused in an Israeli document of playing a part in the attacks.

UNRWA called for a ""complete reversal in policies"" from Israel in response to Monday's strike, including lifting the ban on it delivering aid to northern Gaza.

The victim was found outside a house in Brentwick Gardens on Wednesday morning

Police say 10 people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was fatally stabbed in London.

Officers said the man was found in the street with serious injuries in Brentwick Gardens, Brentford, at 05:15 BST and died at the scene.

It came after the force was alerted to reports of intruders at an address in the same street.

Seven men and three women were subsequently detained and remain in custody.

Det Supt Figo Forouzan, from Met Police, said: ""This is a truly shocking incident that will understandably cause the community concerns.

""I want to reassure the Hounslow residents that we have commenced a thorough investigation with the support of our homicide investigation team to ensure those responsible are brought to justice.""

The force has appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

This is the fourth time in as many months that the prime minister has met President Biden.

I have been in tow each time, and it's been fascinating to get a glimpse of their growing relationship.

And quite some growing it's had to do.

When Rishi Sunak became prime minister, President Biden, in congratulating him, managed to call him Rashee Sanook.

Not long after that, Mr Sunak acknowledged to me that the UK's reputation had ""taken a bit of a knock,"" courtesy of the rolling political chaos of much of 2022.

Core to his brand as prime minister is attempting to personify the opposite: hoping to be seen as dependable, believable, credible, trustworthy.

Little wonder, then, he ducked a question on the way here about what he made of Prince Harry's remarks that the UK is judged globally by the state of the press and the government - both of which the prince reckons are at ""rock bottom.""

But, having tried to prove he can be the gentle jazz of politics rather than the heavy metal that came before, the challenge for Rishi Sunak now is delivery, and quickly, with a general election expected next year.

Ukraine will be a recurring theme on this trip.

Mr Sunak has told us the UK is looking into who was to blame for the destruction of the huge dam there.

He said it was too soon to make ""a definitive judgement.""

But, he added, if it was intentional, it would represent ""the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war.""

The UK and US's ongoing support for Kyiv will be central to the discussions between the leaders at the White House on Thursday.

Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden met in Japan, last month

Also on the agenda, the regulation of artificial intelligence and economic cooperation.

On AI, the prime minister is expected to make the case that the UK can be a global leader on its development and regulation.

And on the economy, Rishi Sunak has said he will ""continue discussing"" America's Inflation Reduction Act - which has seen billions in new subsidies targeted at green industries in the US - with some fretting the UK is being left behind.

You can read more about it here from my colleague Faisal Islam.

The gulf between the president and the prime minister's instincts on this is wide, if not surprising: a Democratic president opting for massive state intervention, in the hope of greening his economy, reviving left behind areas and bringing manufacturing back to the US.

And a Conservative prime minister not naturally drawn towards huge interventions like this - and suggesting ""subsidy races,"" as he put it, were a ""zero sum"" game.

But even if there is a philosophical opposition from some to what the president is doing, what are the political responses to it?

Rishi Sunak said ""we've created lots of jobs"" in green industries and ""reduced carbon faster"" than comparable countries.

He doesn't believe attempting the same plan as Washington would be wise.

Meanwhile, Rachel Reeves - who hopes to become the UK's first ever female chancellor if Labour win the next election - was in the US capital just a few weeks ago, and openly embracing a strategy very similar to Joe Biden's.

Is her plan affordable, and achievable? They are big and, as yet, unanswered questions.

What is much clearer is President Biden's attempts to rewire the global economy has implications all over the place - not least on our own domestic economy - and politics.

The death of a 43-year-old man is the first in the UK to be linked to the ""zombie"" drug xylazine, which is prompting overdose warnings in the US.

Normally used as a large-animal tranquiliser but now being found in heroin, it can cause a dangerously low heart rate and large open skin wounds.

UK experts are calling it ""a really concerning drug"".

They say drug users should be warned it is now present in the UK but there is no safe dose in humans.

Karl Warburton, form Solihull, West Midlands, died in May 2022 at home and had a history of illicit drug use, according to the coroner's report. He had been referred to addiction services on a number of occasions.

An examination of his body detected heroin, fentanyl and cocaine in his system, as well as xylazine.

A report on his death in the Journal of Forens"
117,"ic and Legal Medicine says he was ""likely to have bought heroin and not known it was laced with xylazine and fentanyl"".

""To the best of our knowledge, this is the first death associated with xylazine use reported in the UK, and even Europe, and indicates the entry of xylazine into the UK drug supply,"" it adds.

Xylazine is used by vets as a powerful sedative but it's not approved for use in humans.

Known as ""tranq"" or ""tranq dope"" when cut with heroin and fentanyl by drug dealers, xylazine has been causing huge problems in the US.

If injected directly into someone's bloodstream, it can cause large open skin ulcers to form. These can start to rot and lead to amputation.

It also lowers breathing and heart rate to dangerously low levels, which has led to it being dubbed a ""flesh-eating zombie drug"".

Xylazine emerged on the illicit drug market in Puerto Rico in the early 2000s and has since been found in the US, mainly in the east, and in Canada.

The US government has called it ""an emerging threat"" because of its growing role in fatal overdoses across the country - about 7% of the total.

And in some states, the drug was found in more than a quarter of overdoses.

But until now, there has been no sign of xylazine in the UK.

The drug was detected only because the Birmingham lab that carried out tests after the man's death noticed some strange results and identified xylaxine.

""The drug is not included in standard drug screens in the UK, so we don't know how widespread the xylazine problem is,"" said Dr Caroline Copeland, King's College London lecturer and director of the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths.

""We need to find out how that person ended up with it in his system.""

Xylazine was listed on the man's death certificate as contributing to his death but there was no way of recording it in the UK drug-deaths database.

The report highlights the need to monitor changes in illicit-drug markets and in emerging drugs.

""There is no safe dose to use"", it concludes, because there is an overlap between fatal and non-fatal doses of xylazine reported in people.

James Gallagher wired up for the heatwave experiment

Sometimes it can feel like the world is on fire.

Europe has been baking in a heatwave nicknamed the settimana infernale - ""week of hell"" - in Italy. Temperatures above 50C have been recorded in China and the US, where body bags filled with ice are being used to cool hospital patients. The UK has just had its hottest ever June.

And in 2022, the UK recorded a temperature above 40C for the first time. Last year's heatwave has been blamed for 60,000 deaths across Europe.

It's no wonder the United Nations has warned we now live in the era of ""global boiling"".

""I think it's really important to realise it's no longer just something that's distant or far away from us or something in the future. We are really seeing it now,"" says Prof Lizzie Kendon from the Met Office.

So what does the changing climate mean for our bodies and our health?

I tend to collapse into a sweaty puddle when it gets hot, but I've been invited to take part in a heatwave experiment.

Prof Damian Bailey from the University of South Wales wants to give me a typical heatwave encounter. So we're going to start at 21C, crank up the thermostat to 35C and then finally up to 40.3C - equivalent to the UK's hottest day.

""You will be sweating and your body's physiology is going to change quite considerably,"" Prof Bailey warns me.

Prof Bailey leads me into his environmental chamber. It's a room-sized piece of scientific equipment that can precisely control the temperature, humidity and oxygen levels inside this airtight space.

I've been here once before to explore the effects of cold.

But the shiny steel walls, heavy door and tiny portholes take on new meaning in anticipation of the temperature being cranked up.

I feel like I'm staring out of my oven.

The temperature starts at a perfectly pleasant 21C when the first instruction to ""completely strip everything off"" comes from Prof Bailey.

In response to a raised eyebrow, I'm reassured we're going to work out how sweaty I get, by seeing how my weight changes.

James getting wired up for the experiment inside the environmental chamber at the University of South Wales.

Next, I'm connected to a dizzying array of gizmos tracking the temperature of my skin and my internal organs, my heart rate and blood pressure. A huge mouthpiece analyses the air I exhale and an ultrasound inspects the flow of blood to my brain through the carotid arteries in my neck.

""Blood pressure is working nicely, heart rate is working nicely, all of the physiological signals at the moment are telling me that you're in spiffing shape,"" Prof Bailey tells me.

We have one quick brain test to complete - memorising a list of 30 words - and then the fans kick in. The temperature is starting to rise.

My body has one simple goal - to keep the core temperature around my heart, lungs, liver and other organs at about 37C.

""The thermostat in the brain, or hypothalamus, is constantly tasting the temperature, then it sends out all of these signals to try to maintain that,"" says Prof Bailey.

We take a pause at 35C to take some more measurements. It's warm in here now. It's not uncomfortable - I'm just relaxing in a chair - but I wouldn't want to work or exercise in this.

Prof Bailey is also feeling the heat inside the chamber

Some changes in my body are already clear. I look redder. Damian does too, he's stuck in here with me. That's because the blood vessels near the surface of my skin are opening up to make it easier for my warm blood to lose heat into the air.

Also I'm sweating - not dripping, but positively glistening - and as the sweat evaporates, that cools me down.

We then plough on to 40.3C, and now I feel like the heat is pounding me.

""It's not linear, it's exponential. Five degrees centigrade [more] doesn't sound much, but it really is physiologically so much more of a challenge,"" Prof Bailey says.

I'm glad we're not going higher. When I wipe my hand across my brow it is sodden. It's time to repeat the tests.

When I chuck my sweaty clothes on the floor, towel off and climb back on the scales I'm shocked to learn I've lost more than a third of a litre's worth of water during the course of the experiment.

The cost of opening up all those blood vessels near my skin to lose heat is also clear. My heart rate has increased significantly and at 40C it is pumping an extra litre of blood per minute around my body than it was at 21C.

This extra strain on the heart is why there is an increase in deaths from heart attacks and strokes when temperatures soar.

And as the blood heads to my skin, it's my brain that loses out. Blood flow goes down and so does my short-term memory.

But my body's main goal - keeping my core temperature at around 37C - has been achieved.

""Your body is working really quite nicely to try to defend that core temperature, but of course, the numbers are suggesting you weren't the same beast at 40 degrees as you were at 21 and that's in less than an hour,"" says Prof Bailey.

In my experiment only the temperature was changed, but the other crucial factor to consider is the amount of water vapour in the air - the humidity.

If you've ever been really uncomfortable on a muggy night then you can blame the humidity as it impairs our body's ability to cool down.

Sweating alone isn't enough - it's only when the sweat evaporates into the air that it gives us that cooling effect.

When"
118,"there are high levels of water already in the air, it's harder for sweat to evaporate.

Damian kept the humidity fixed at 50% (not unusual for the UK), but a team at Pennsylvania State University in the US tested a bunch of healthy young adults at different combinations of temperature and humidity. They were looking for the moment when core body temperature started to rise rapidly.

""That's when it becomes dangerous. Our core temperature starts to rise and that can lead to organ failure,"" says researcher Rachel Cottle.

And that danger point is reached at lower temperatures when the humidity is high.

The concern is that heatwaves are not only becoming more frequent, longer in duration and more severe, but they're becoming more humid too, says Cottle.

She points out that last year, India and Pakistan were hit by a severe heatwave with both critical temperatures and high humidity. ""It's definitely a 'now' problem, not a future problem,"" she says.

The human body is built to operate at a core temperature of about 37C degrees. We become more light-headed and prone to fainting as the core rises closer to 40C.

High core temperatures damage our body's tissues, such as heart muscle and the brain. Eventually this becomes deadly.

""Once the core temperature rises to around about 41-42 degrees centigrade we start to see really, really significant problems and if not treated the individual will actually die as a result, succumbing to hyperthermia,"" says Prof Bailey.

People's ability to cope with the heat varies, but age and ill health can make us far more vulnerable, and temperatures we may have once enjoyed on holidays may be dangerous at a different stage in life.

""You're going to leave the lab today with a smile on your face - all of these statistics coming are telling me that you have risen to the challenge and you've done a jolly good job,"" says Prof Bailey

But old age, heart disease, lung disease, dementia and some medications mean the body is already working harder to keep going, and is less able to respond to the heat.

""Every day it's a physiological challenge for them, now when you throw in extra spicy heat and humidity, sometimes they can't rise to that challenge,"" says Prof Bailey.

Many of the tips for coping with the heat are obvious and well known - stay in the shade, wear loose fitting clothes, avoid alcohol, keep your house cool, don't exercise in the hottest parts of the day and stay hydrated (you saw how much I sweated in an hour).

""Another tip is try not to get sunburned. A mild sunburn can knock out the ability to thermoregulate or to sweat for as long as two weeks,"" says Prof Bailey.

But dealing with the heat is something we could all have to become used to dealing with.

Without action on climate change Prof Lizzie Kendon said the hottest UK summer day could increase by 6C under a high-emission scenario: ""That's a huge increase by the end of the century.""

Ukraine has launched a drone attack on Moscow, the Russian defence ministry says, forcing flights to be diverted from Vnukovo International Airport.

Five drones were reportedly used in Tuesday's attack, which also targeted locations in the wider region around the capital.

The defence ministry said all the drones were shot down and there were no casualties or damage.

Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the alleged attack.

Restrictions at Vnukovo airport, one of Moscow's three international airports, have now been lifted. Flights from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt were among those affected.

According to the defence ministry, four of the drones flying in the Moscow region were shot down by air defence systems. A fifth was intercepted electronically before crashing.

""An attempt by the Kyiv regime to attack a zone where civil infrastructure is located, including an airport that receives international flights, is a new terrorist act,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram.

Russian state media said one of the drones crashed in the town of Kubinka, which is roughly 36km (22 miles) from Vnukovo airport in the south-west of the city.

Another was reportedly shot down near the village of Valuevo, also near the airport.

The BBC is trying to verify this information independently.

This is not the first drone attack to target Moscow. In May, Russia's defence ministry said at least eight drones caused minor damage.

It was the first time the city had been targeted by multiple drones since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and came after Moscow blamed Kyiv for a drone attack on the Kremlin.

Tuesday's drone attack comes after Ukraine launched its counter-offensive against Russia.

This has not yet achieved the sort of speed and momentum some had hoped for, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who previously acknowledged progress was slow.

Meanwhile, the death toll from a Russian drone attack on the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Monday has risen to three, according to the local mayor. Several other people were injured.

Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing

A teenager who helped jail her paternal grandfather after he sexually abused her as a small child is speaking out to ""take away the shame"" for survivors like her. Poppy hopes her story will change attitudes and help others.

The 18-year-old has set aside her right to anonymity because she believes ""if people can see a face behind something so taboo, it makes it more relatable"".

She describes how, as a small child, she thought the abuse she suffered was normal - and how she felt enormous relief when she eventually told her parents, aged 11.

Only by talking openly, says Poppy, will others understand that abuse can happen within any family.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Poppy says she ""lost a lot of family"" after helping jail her grandfather

""Why should we be hidden? It is a crime, as simple as that,"" she says.

""I am like any other person probably going through it. Survivors are very good at acting like nothing is wrong, people didn't see it in me.""

Poppy is speaking out as new data shows more cases of child sexual abuse are being reported to police in England and Wales than ever before.

There were 105,542 sexual offences recorded against children in the year up to March.

The Home Office figures have been analysed for the BBC by the Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse (CSA Centre), which studies the causes, impact and scale of abuse. The centre says greater awareness is a key reason for a 57% increase in recorded offences over six years.

Child sexual abuse within a family environment accounts for nearly half the cases.

That's why Poppy believes talking publicly will help children realise that someone will listen to them.

It's a hot summer's day. At a busy airfield in Kent, Poppy is pulling on overalls and being helped into a parachute harness.

Four days after finishing her A-levels and a week before her 18th birthday, she is about to jump out of a plane to raise money for a charity that helped her deal with the abuse that blighted her early years.

Poppy believes doing her first skydive mirrors the ""scary leap"" you take when you tell someone about abuse"
119,".

Her mother, Miranda, is there to support her. Her father, David, is working away, but she video calls him just before she climbs into the plane.

They are a close family. They've had to be to survive the toughest of times.

Poppy compares skydiving to taking the leap to tell someone about her abuse

They believe Poppy was first abused when she was a toddler.

""I thought grandparents did that to their grandchildren,"" says Poppy. ""I thought that was quite normal.""

David's father, John, would help out by looking after Poppy when needed.

""I knew the cues,"" Poppy says. When the regular children's programme she watched with him ended, then the abuse would begin.

Today Poppy is eloquent and thoughtful, but as she casts her mind back to that time she falters as she searches for words.

""It would always start with: 'Can you help me come and get dressed?' And I'd have to go to his bedroom. I was made to do things to him, he would then do things to me.""

When I say to her that she was groomed, she says yes and describes the complex relationship she had with her paternal grandfather. She says she felt so much shame and believed she was in the wrong, so wanted to protect him.

At the age of five, just before going on a trip to Legoland, she tried to tell her mother about the abuse.

A photo taken that day shows a little girl with long blonde plaits smiling up at her parents. If it is hard for Poppy to find the right words now, this is a reminder of how impossible it must have been at such a young age.

Poppy tried to tell her parents what was happening when she was five

""She started to tell us, then giggled,"" says Miranda. ""We just didn't really realise what she was trying to tell us.""

Her parents thought she had seen John when he had come out of the shower. David spoke to his father.

""His immediate response was - 'I might have got changed in front of her,'"" says David. His father promised it wouldn't happen again.

""He literally shut it down completely, but in a calm way. And I thought, OK! He is my dad!""

The abuse stopped, but as Poppy grew, so did her anxiety. She describes the guilt she felt as ""eating her alive"".

A teenager's story of survival and making a difference. By talking openly about the sexual abuse that devastated her early life, Poppy is determined to challenge the taboos that make it difficult for survivors to ask for and get help.

At school, aged 10 and 11, Poppy was having lessons warning about sexual exploitation and grooming. She began to recognise what had happened to her.

""I'm sat there thinking, 'I'm involved in that',"" Poppy says. ""That's me, that's dark. That's disgusting.""

The CSA Centre says an estimated one child in every 10 will have their life damaged by some form of sexual abuse by the age of 16.

Then came a day when Poppy was being physically sick. Her mother suggested they go for a walk. It was then Poppy took the leap and told her about the abuse.

""I just needed to keep her safe,"" says Poppy's mother Miranda

""It was sickening,"" says Miranda. ""She obviously saw the look on my face, and was like, 'Mum, please don't tell anybody. I don't want anything to happen to him. I love him.' She immediately said, 'It's my fault. I'm not a nice person.'""

Miranda says she was ""clueless"" as to what to do next. ""I'd never even come across anyone that had been through this. I just needed to keep her safe.""

Poppy had been worried about her mum's reaction, but says it was an immediate ""we are going to get through this"". The relief she felt was huge, because ""it was now in other people's hands"".

They headed home, and as Miranda puts it: ""Cried a lot, then it was, how do I tell David?""

She phoned her husband - as he was working away.

He describes his ""huge mixed emotions"" when he heard the news.

""I had to make this call to ultimately report my father,"" he says. ""It was incredibly tough. However, she's my daughter, and she comes first.""

The grandfather never admitted what he had done - says child protection officer Det Con Deniz Aslan

Poppy was then interviewed by Det Con Deniz Aslan, from Kent Police's child protection team, along with a social worker.

Det Con Aslan remembers the 11-year-old being very anxious. This was the first time she had explained to anyone exactly what her grandfather had done.

""Any sexual abuse of a child is serious,"" DC Aslan says. ""But the rape of an under 13-year-old, I don't think you get more serious than that.""

She says the grandfather never admitted what he had done.

Miranda's voice breaks as she describes being told by the police the details of what had happened.

""She was being raped by him. And she felt responsible for it. No child should feel responsible for that,"" she says.

""Poppy would never give us the full detail of what he'd done. She was trying to protect us.""

For David, there was the distress of knowing his father was the abuser.

""He was abusing our daughter, and then five minutes later, he was having a cup of tea with us. So I felt, who is this man?

""But then equally, as a child, I had many happy memories. There was a real conflict going on in my mind.""

Poppy's parents sold their business and moved house to keep her safe

It took 18 months for the case against the grandfather, John, to reach trial.

Across England and Wales, only 12% of reported offences result in charges - according to the CSA Centre - and it typically takes nearly two years for those to get to court.

Poppy's recorded interview was played, then she was cross-examined. She had just turned 13.

""I was so desperate to fight my own corner,"" she says. ""In some ways, there was a good amount of anger behind me, so telling my side of the story was incredibly important.""

In 2018, John was found guilty on three counts, including rape, and was jailed for 13-and-a-half years.

The judge described Poppy's testimony as ""heart-rending"" and ""utterly compelling"". John's defence that she had made it up at her parents' instigation was described as ""quite absurd"".

He died in prison last year.

The conviction was important for Poppy, but so was the counselling she received. She had to wait five months for that support - now, it can take much longer. At Family Matters in Kent, where Poppy went, they have more than 300 abuse survivors waiting.

""When you want help, you want help now,"" says the charity's chief executive, Mary Trevillion - whose team spends a lot of time risk assessing people while they wait for a counsellor.

She also finds many people hide what has happened to them, only asking for help when they are adults.

The Home Office told us it was significantly increasing support for victims of child sexual abuse - including quadrupling money for victims' services by 2024-25.

It also said it recognised that child sexual abuse was an ""often-hidden"" crime, and that was why the government was making it ""mandatory for those who work with young people to report any suspicions that a child is being sexually abused or exploited"".

The small plane climbs high into the cloudless sky.

Poppy is doing the skydive to raise money for a helpline that supports abuse survivors while they wait to see a counsellor. So far, she has raised more than £70,000.

Poppy and her instructor shuffle to the edge of the plane's open door - the patchwork fields of Kent spreads out beneath them.

Poppy says her life now is ""incredible""

Minutes later, Poppy is on the ground - safe and laughing.

""You've got that initial panic,"" she says, ""but then it's just that relief"
120,"to jump out - you are in it now, you've got to do it.""

Thinking back to the 11-year-old who found the courage to tell her mother about the abuse, Poppy says ""I'd give her a massive hug. Without her strength, I don't think I'd be here today and the life I have now is incredible.""

Her message to others who are struggling with abuse is ""take that jump"" - tell someone.

""I can't promise you will be believed by everyone,"" she says. ""But I can promise there is someone who will believe you, and there is a way through this.""

Tyler McDermott was found with a gunshot injury on Norman Road

Two men have been arrested after a teenager died in a shooting in north London.

Tyler McDermott, 17, was found by the emergency services on Norman Road in Tottenham at about 04:20 BST on Thursday and died on Friday .

The Met said two 19-year-olds have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody.

The detective leading the investigation appealed to a group of people at the scene at the time to come forward.

Det Ch Insp Neil John said: ""There is still significant work to do to identify those involved in Tyler's murder.

""There were a large number of people in the area at the time of Tyler's murder and I am reiterating my appeal to anyone who was there, or who has information about this incident, to contact police immediately.""

The Met added Tyler's family continue to be supported by specialist officers and a post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place on Sunday.

Singer Melody Thornton has apologised after rowdy audience members halted a performance of The Bodyguard musical.

The ex-Pussycat Dolls star was unable to complete the show's final song due to the disruption at Manchester's Palace Theatre on Friday.

Speaking on Instagram, Thornton said she ""fought really hard"" to finish the show, but it had not been possible.

The theatre said two audience members who refused to sit down and stop singing were removed by security staff.

The theatre had previously asked people not to sing along to the stage adaptation of the 1992 film, which stars Thornton and former Emmerdale and Hollyoaks actor Ayden Callaghan in the roles made famous by Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner.

A representative said staff were ""disappointed that the last 10 minutes of the show needed to be cancelled due to disruptive customers refusing to stay seated and spoiling the performance for others"".

They praised the work of the venue's security for ""dealing with these difficult circumstances in a professional and calm way"" and thanked Greater Manchester Police (GMP) ""for their assistance"".

The force confirmed officers had attended after two people were removed by security staff.

Audience member Karl Bradley told BBC Radio Manchester that some spectators in the higher tier had started a countdown ahead of the finale, which features the classic song I Will Always Love You.

He said they ""started to project themselves"" by singing along and attempted to hit the song's high notes, but could not ""and that's when the chaos began"".

He said Thornton's microphone was cut, though the star kept singing, but ""eventually the lights cut off as the drama unfolded"".

He added that there were ""audible gasps"" from other audience members and people were ""all stood up, looking up"".

Speaking on Instagram, Thornton said she was ""just very, very sorry that we couldn't finish the show"".

""I fought really hard, it feels awful,"" she said.

""I respect that you paid your money and I am so grateful to everyone who respects the people on stage who want to give you a beautiful show.""

Callaghan tweeted that a ""few badly behaved individuals ruined it"".

He said there had been ""disgusting behaviour"" and though the cast ""wanted to carry on"", they were unable to because ""it had become a major incident"".

He added that he was ""really sorry to what was 99.9% a brilliant audience"".

GMP said two people were removed by security staff and spoken to by officers at the theatre.

It said ""a decision about any further action will be made once the evidence has been reviewed"".

The theatre's representative said future performances would ""continue as planned"".

""We ask that customers are considerate towards the cast, fellow audience members and theatre team so that everyone can enjoy the wonderful entertainment on stage,"" they added.

Flowers are left on the pavement to remember the children shot dead in class in Belgrade

There is an awful silence hanging over the steep hill on which Vladislav Ribnikar elementary school sits.

On Wednesday, a 13-year-old entered the school, armed with two guns and a ""kill list"" - and shot dead eight fellow students and a security guard. Six other children remain in hospital.

The school is at the heart of this central Belgrade community, where streams of mourners are arriving, bearing flowers and soft toys.

Exactly 24 hours after the worst school shooting in Serbian history, pupils from the next-door college stand along the street to stand in silence and remember those killed.

""I am crushed,"" says final-year school student Alex Oborina, 19, beside some of the handwritten notes left on the pavement.

""We have failed as a society because this is something that should not happen to a 13-year-old. He should not be grabbing a gun and going into his school and shooting his friends.""

Alex seems to echo the sentiment everyone here feels.

""This is probably the worst thing that has ever happened in my life. We need to use this as a stepping stone to rebuild. ""

Alex Oborina believes the children's parents will never have justice for what happened

I ask if the suspect's age of 13 will make it even harder for Serbian society to come to terms with this attack because he is too young to face prosecution.

""Whatever happened, even if he had been 18 or 19, justice would never have been served for those parents who lost their children.""

The boy was arrested by police immediately after the shooting. His father who legally owned both guns was also detained, as was his mother.

His lawyer, Irina Borovic, says he has been interviewed by doctors and has now been taken to a Belgrade neurology and psychiatry clinic for children and youth.

The motive for the attack remains unclear.

But of the victims, seven of the eight who were killed were girls.

During the afternoon, a large crowd gathers outside the school. Most are pupils from elsewhere in Belgrade who have come here to pay their respects.

Thousands of people, mainly pupils from other Belgrade schools, converged on the school

Mother-of-two Sanja Bastic has travelled here with teachers from her own children's school as a sign of solidarity.

She begins to weep as she explains how her 10-year-old"
121,"son asked her husband last night what would happen if a shooting happened to them next.

""My son asked, 'how would you feel if you were having to wait outside the school and I didn't come out?'

""The kids are sometimes smarter than we are and notice things we don't.""

Sanja believes her country has to look wider than the actions of just one teenager.

""It's not the kid's fault. It's our fault. This is a combination of things that are happening here. We are a great country with good people and we're welcoming but we have problems here that we need to solve drastically.""

Violence both online and in real life have to be addressed urgently, she adds.

""I'm afraid this may be the beginning. We just need to stop it. We have now realised that in our country something like this can happen, and we need to take care of our kids.""

A teddy bear is a painful reminder that most of the victims of the shooting were children

A short distance from the school, at the Ministry of Education, the woman responsible for preventing violence in classrooms in Serbia tells the BBC that nothing in the suspect's school records showed any sign that he might be capable of such devastating violence.

""Official information we have about this particular case tell us that nothing suggested something like this will happen,"" says Milja Krivokuca.

""The most important thing for us to do now is to support everyone, stabilise the situation and then we will go back and look retrospectively to see if something could have been done differently.""

At least two unions representing teachers say their members will go on strike tomorrow, demanding better protection for staff and pupils.

President Aleksandar Vucic has suggested the age of criminal liability may be lowered from 14 to 12 in the wake of the killings.

Ms Krivokuca agrees: ""It is my opinion that it would be desirable to lower the age for criminal responsibility because of one important reason: It is necessary to secure maximum protection [for schools]"".

Serbia should also compare its legislation with neighbours in Europe and further afield, she believes.

""We might need to see what other countries are doing where legal responsibility starts at 12, and sometimes 10 years old.""

Melody Powell has her heart set on a post-pandemic trip to New York

Major airlines are charging some disabled passengers double to fly from the UK, the BBC has found.

Nearly 30 carriers contacted by the BBC said passengers with mobility problems must purchase a full-price ticket for a personal care assistant (PA).

This is despite Civil Aviation Authority guidance on EU law, maintained by the UK post-Brexit, urging airlines to subsidise the cost.

Disabled people with mobility issues say the situation is discriminatory.

Melody Powell has been saving up to visit friends in New York who kept her company online during years of Covid shielding, but says the extra cost makes flying impossibly expensive.

Melody, 25, uses a wheelchair and needs to fly with a PA to help her reach the toilet and get off the plane. She now has enough money to pay for her own fare - almost £600 - but is still a long way from being able to afford another full-price ticket.

""Seeing how much it will cost me to fly because I'm disabled is quite scary,"" she says.

LISTEN: You can hear more about airline charging on the BBC Access All podcast.

Richard Amm is unable to visit his family in South Africa during the festive season or at short notice, when PA tickets can cost £1,500.

When his 77-year-old mother broke three ribs recently, flying over was too costly.

""I would love to visit my mum,"" Richard says. ""But facing double the cost, it just isn't really feasible for me to go.""

Richard says the cost of a PA ticket means he is unable to visit his family in South Africa at Christmas

The 40-year-old uses a wheelchair and has trouble lifting his arms, so needs help on long flights.

He feels the current situation is ""totally discriminatory"" and makes it even harder for disabled people to manage the already high costs of living.

""Most of us are too poor to even afford a ticket for ourselves,"" Richard says.

According to disability charity Scope the average additional monthly cost of being disabled is about £600 - because of the higher cost of specialist equipment and higher usage of essentials like energy.

But the employment rate for disabled people is 54%, compared to 82% for non-disabled people.

BBC News contacted more than 100 airlines, including all that fly from Heathrow, to find out how many insist on a PA and whether they offer a discount.

British Airways told the BBC that it provided discounted PA fares on direct flights to Brazil and US, but refused to specify by how much. US law allows for subsidised tickets, but only if the airline believes a PA is necessary for safety reasons and the individual does not.

But in reality, the BBC has been told, this excludes the majority of disabled passengers as it is extremely rare for the clause to be activated - as most people who are told they need a PA already accept that they do.

Being told by airlines to travel with, and pay for, a PA is a common frustration for disabled passengers, says Josh Wintersgill, a wheelchair user and entrepreneur who is trying to improve aviation accessibility.

""With many not requiring companions, being forced to travel with someone feels very undermining and incurs additional costs. This is significantly unfair and borderline discriminatory,"" he says.

He says there is a need for ""drastic international collaboration"" to improve ""outdated and ineffective regulations and guidelines"".

European aviation regulations, maintained by the UK post-Brexit, explicitly advise airlines to offer discounts for passengers who require an escort, but they are advisory only, and cannot be enforced.

The CAA, which regulates UK aviation policy set by the Department of Transport, also recommends free or discounted PA tickets, but again lacks the power to impose them. The CAA's chief, Anne Bowles, told the BBC that while there was no legal requirement for airlines to offer free or discounted seats to an accompanying person, ""our view is that it is best practice for airlines to do so"".

Adopting these recommendations would bring the aviation sector in line with travelcard schemes across the UK that provide free or discounted travel to disabled people - and sometimes their carers - on buses, trains and taxis. Similar PA concessions also apply at ticketed events.

Melody is frustrated that there is no obligation for airlines to offer discounted fares.

""When it comes to any sort of legislation that's meant to help disabled people, it's never a legally binding thing,"" she says. ""It's always 'a suggestion' that people conveniently forget exists.""

Airlines and airports are required to provide disabled passengers with assistance to the plane free of charge, including help to board and disembark the aircraft, in line with anti-discrimination commitments.

However, during the flight itself, airline staff are not expected to help disabled passengers access the toilet or evacuate the aircraft.

This is because airlines are not considered service providers under the UK Equality Act, leaving few legal options to challenge disability discrimination in air travel.

Airlines are only required to follow the Montreal Convention, a set of rules which limit responsibility to personal injury or loss and damage of baggage.

Campaigner Chris Wood said more legislation was needed because the current advice was just ""guidance, not the law"".

What the rules should be and what we want are ""two different things"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, suggesting that airlines should show ""a little bit of empathy"".

The founder of Flying Disabled added that some airlines are ""great"", but they all ""need guidance"".

Airlines and airports are required to help disabled passengers on and off planes free of charge

Last year the government conducted an aviation consultation that addressed accessibility for disabled passengers but, like its aviation passenger charter, it did not specifically address additional ticket costs for PAs.

When asked by the BBC over the widespread failure of airlines to adopt recommendations to subsidise PA fares, the Department for Transport said it was ""committed to ensuring"" accessible air travel but did not address the additional ticket charges.

Enfor"
122,"cing global disability rights in air travel is a challenge because there is no collective means of imposing obligations internationally.

For example, when a 2019 lawsuit in Canada found that requiring obese passengers and those with a disability to purchase two seats was discriminatory, the country's airlines began to subsidise PA tickets - but for domestic flights only.

Legal experts have told the BBC that the most probable path for change is for a bloc of countries, such as the EU, to impose a member-wide standard that might then become a global norm. Post-Brexit, the UK's position would require its own unique commitments.

A host of failings have been highlighted by the disabled community in recent years. These include being left on planes or at terminals for a long time when waiting for assistance, difficulties accessing the toilet and wheelchairs being lost or damaged.

Rather than face the additional costs and challenges of flying as a disabled passenger, many avoid it.

Ben Iles, 44, likes to travel but has flown just twice in the past 20 years, having had bad experiences getting on and off planes - he now prefers to use a van that is adapted to his wheelchair.

""I have everything I need,"" he says.

But there are some signs of progress for disabled and less mobile travellers - the Department for Transport said last month that it planned to give the CAA the power to fine airlines for breaching consumer laws.

This includes removing the reimbursement cap for damaged wheelchairs, which are currently treated like regular luggage and valued by weight, not price.

The CAA has also suggested a ranking to provide transparency about the disability performance of different airlines.

In response to the BBC's findings, Airlines UK, the industry trade body, said its airlines held a ""proven track record"" of constructive engagement on disability issues and would continue to be supportive of any initiative that improved quality and access to air travel.

Edwards, who joined the BBC in 1984, is one of the UK's most high-profile broadcasters

BBC News presenter Huw Edwards, who has been named as the presenter at the centre of an explicit photo row, is one of the UK's most high-profile broadcasters.

He has been the BBC's choice to front coverage of major national events, a reflection of how well-regarded he is by the corporation.

Trusted by viewers, he has over decades built a reputation as a reliable and calming presence on screen.

Last Wednesday, on what transpired to be his last day on air for BBC News before the scandal broke, Edwards was broadcasting from Edinburgh as Scotland prepared to greet King Charles.

Less than a week later, the 61-year-old's broadcasting career is under serious pressure, after his wife issued a statement naming him as the BBC presenter facing a series of damaging allegations.

He joined BBC News as a trainee in 1984 and he eventually secured a job as political reporter for BBC Wales. Just two years later, he became BBC Wales's parliamentary correspondent.

By the early 1990s he was the BBC's chief political correspondent at Westminster.

He became a regular face on the BBC News channel, then called BBC News 24, after it launched in 1997.

Edwards became one of the main anchors on the Six O'Clock News in 1999

In its early days, the channel was plagued by technical difficulties, but Edwards' confident and level-headed performance in challenging circumstances was said to have impressed BBC bosses.

Around the same time, Edwards was working as an occasional cover presenter on BBC One's Six O'Clock News, one of the most-viewed television news bulletins in the UK, becoming one of the programme's main anchors in 1999.

Four years later, he was promoted to the Ten O'Clock News, widely seen as the BBC's flagship bulletin, and was increasingly asked to present and commentate on major national events for the BBC.

They included the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (as they were known at the time) in 2011, the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh (2021), the Queen's Diamond and Platinum Jubilee (2012 and 2022) and the coronation of King Charles (2023).

He was also on air when Nelson Mandela died in 2013, and co-hosted the results of the Brexit referendum in 2016.

But perhaps the biggest single moment in Edwards' long presenting career came last September, when he announced the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

He had started his shift early that day following rumours of the Queen's declining health, presenting rolling news coverage from 14:00 before confirming the Monarch's death to the nation that evening while wearing a black tie.

He went on to front coverage of the late Queen's funeral. He was widely praised by viewers, and the coverage won Edwards and his colleagues a TRIC award, presented last month.

Edwards has presented the flagship News at Ten bulletin for the last 20 years

As well as major royal events, Edwards had recently become the face of the BBC's general election coverage.

The Welsh broadcaster was one of the BBC's top earners. In 2017, the first year the BBC was compelled by Parliament to publish the salaries of its star presenters, it was revealed Edwards made £550,000.

Following a flurry of negative headlines about the amount of money the BBC spent on top talent, and the disparity between some of its male and female stars, Edwards took a pay cut, and six years later his salary stands at £435,000.

Edwards made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall, presenting a BBC News report on a fictionalised attack on the British intelligence service MI6.

In an interview with BBC Radio Cymru in 2021, Edwards indicated he may not have many years left as the corporation's chief news anchor due to the demands of the role.

""The nightly news business, after 20 years, that can be taxing, even though I still enjoy the job,"" he said. ""But I don't think I'll be doing that for long… I think it's fair for the viewers to get a change.""

Edwards was named as the BBC presenter by his wife Vicky Flind on Wednesday

In the same year, Edwards made a Welsh-language documentary about his career, during which he revealed he had suffered bouts of depression over 20 years, and had been left ""bedridden"" by his struggle with his mental health.

But after a distinguished career at the BBC, there are now serious questions about Edwards' career.

After the Sun published allegations on Friday that an unnamed BBC presenter had paid large sums of money for explicit images of an individual, there were days of speculation about who the presenter might be.

Over the following days, the Sun, and later BBC News, released further allegations, keeping the story in the headlines.

Finally, on Wednesday, his wife Vicky Flind confirmed Edwards' identity on his behalf, saying she was doing so ""primarily out of concern for his mental well-being"" and to protect their five children.

""Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues,"" she said. ""The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters, he has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in-patient hospital care where he'll stay for the foreseeable future.""

""Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published.""

Protesters in Paris have attacked one of French President Emmanuel Macron's favourite restaurants, as tensions over controversial pension"
123,"reforms continue.

Riot police had to form a barricade around La Rotonde bistro, which was briefly set on fire.

Thursday was the 11th day of unrest since January, over legislation raising the retirement age by two years, from 62 to 64.

The country awaits a decision on the validity of the legislation next week.

The Constitutional Council will rule on the reforms on 14 April, and has the power to strike down some or all of it.

Mr Macron is currently in China to meet President Xi Jinping.

The unrest, along with strike action, has caused disruption throughout France, and on Thursday demonstrations again took place across the country.

Trade union leaders are hoping for a large turnout to keep up momentum ahead of the council's decision.

""We haven't given up yet and we don't intend to,"" said public servant Davy Chretien, 50, quoted by AFP news agency in Marseille.

In Paris protesters threw stones, bottles and paint at police at La Rotonde - a famous cafe frequented by figures including Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. Mr Macron and his team celebrated there following his 2017 election victory.

Earlier, striking railway workers stormed the former headquarters of Credit Lyonnais bank, which now houses the BlackRock investment company and other firms.

Protesters forced their way into the central Paris building that houses BlackRock, chanting and setting off fireworks

France's interior ministry estimated 570,000 people took part in Thursday's strikes, although French unions claimed the number was far higher, at nearly two million.

The unions have called for new strikes and protests on 13 April - a day before the ruling on the reform.

Though the protests have been largely peaceful, there has been an element of violence since the government in March decided to force the legislation through the lower house of parliament - where it lacks an absolute majority - without a vote.

Mr Macron has defended the move, saying the reform is a necessity.

Russia has repeatedly attacked the Ukrainian port city of Odesa in the days since it withdrew from the grain deal

A short life, with its flaws, but the only diplomatic light in the darkness of Russia's invasion.

It had allowed Ukraine to export its grain to the world through the Black Sea.

A third less than normal, but still 33 million tonnes. However, in recent months, its health had deteriorated.

Russia was accused of slowing the route with naval blockades and long inspections, and the deal finally succumbed.

Last week saw Moscow's official withdrawal. Russia then launched a wave of missile strikes on ports it once promised to leave alone.

EXPLAINED: What was the Ukraine grain deal?

One site destroyed was a grain terminal owned by one of Ukraine's biggest producers, Kernel. Officials say more than 60,000 tonnes of grain has been destroyed in the past week.

""We stopped our exports for the first two to three months of the war,"" explains Yevhen Osypov, Kernel's CEO.

""The prices of oil and grain went up by 50%, and you can see the same happening again now.""

While global grain supplies seem to be stable for now, global markets saw the price of grain rise by 8% within a day of Russia pulling out - the highest daily rise since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year.

Russian President Vladimir Putin now says his country ""is capable of replacing the Ukrainian grain both on a commercial and free-of-charge basis, especially as we expect another record harvest this year"".

In an article published on the Kremlin's website ahead of this week's Russia-Africa summit, President Putin wrote that ""Russia will continue its energetic efforts to provide supplies of grain, food products, fertilisers and other goods to Africa"".

Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world's leading grain exporters.

At the weekend Russian missile strikes severely damaged Odesa's Transfiguration Cathedral, in the city's Unesco world heritage-listed historic centre

The Kremlin had earlier agreed not to target port infrastructure in three locations in the region, but that diplomatic shield is no more.

With damaged ports, no agreed corridor through the Black Sea and Russia controlling most of the coastline, Mr Osypov believes Ukraine's grain export capacity will drop by a further 50%.

""It's a huge challenge for our farmers because they'll have to sell their products 20% below cost,"" says Mr Osypov, who predicts there will be fewer people in the future working less land.

The death of the grain deal extends well beyond Odesa's ports. The city's mayor Gennady Trukhanov thinks Moscow just wants to show nothing will be exported without them, and he's right.

""The most terrible thing is that in order to achieve their goal, they've attacked innocent people,"" he says.

Ukraine is known as Europe's breadbasket because of the vast amount of grain it produces

You're left in little doubt over the scale of Ukrainian grain production when standing 40 metres high on top of a silo in the central Poltava region.

The plant we're in can hold 120,000 tonnes. It's around a third full, and while Ukraine is unable to export through the Black Sea, it will keep filling up.

The site is surrounded by an endless agricultural expanse.

This is a country which can't suddenly stop producing grain. It has to go somewhere - or at least that's the hope.

""We feel there is a need for us to harvest as much grain as possible,"" says Yulia, a lab technician at Kernel, as she pours samples into a pipe.

Before the birth of the grain deal, tens of millions of people from some of the world's poorest countries were at risk of starvation because of Ukraine's inability to export it.

Twelve months later, that risk has returned.

""The Russians probably don't understand what hunger is,"" says Yulia. ""People are starving, there's a large supply, but they can't get it for no reason.""

Lab technicians like Yulia test Ukraine's grain once it has been harvested

Moscow had threatened to pull out before, mainly saying there were too many restrictions on its own agricultural goods.

It also wants a major bank let into a global payment system, restrictions lifted on Russian fertiliser companies, and for its ships to get full access to insurance and foreign ports.

President Putin has now turned those complaints into demands. However, if they were to be met, that would require a relaxation of western sanctions, which is hard to imagine.

Last July, the Kremlin had seemed keen to be ""part of the solution"" when it came to the food crisis that it has directly caused by invading Ukraine.

Battlefield frustrations seem to have changed that stance.

Despite the lack of a pulse, Turkey - one of the main brokers of the grain deal along with the United Nations - is still hopeful it can be resuscitated.

The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres (left) and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan helped broker the grain deal in 2022

So, assuming the initiative is indeed dead, is there an heir apparent? An alternative solution for Ukraine to export?

Road and rail has been used through neighbouring countries like Romania and Poland, but there have been times when Ukrainian grain has flooded their markets and driven down prices, to the annoyance of farmers.

The River Danube has also been developed as a route through central Europe, with two million tonnes of grain making it through in the last 12 months, compared with 600,000 the year before.

However both scratch the surface of what Ukraine hopes to shift, and are much more expensive logistically.

During her recent visit I asked the head of US Aid, Samantha Power, whether Ukraine's status as ""Europe's breadbasket"" was a thing of the past.

She'd just announced a package worth almost a billion dollars for Ukraine, which included agricultural modernisation.

""We're doing what we can, but there's no substitute for peace,"" was her reply.

The stepfather of a five-year-old girl has pleaded guilty to her murder.

Nadia"
124,"Zofia Kalinowska died after being found injured at her family home at Fernagh Drive in Newtownabbey in December 2019.

Her mother, 28 year-old Aleksandra Wahab, and the child's stepfather, 34-year-old Abdul Wahab, went on trial on Wednesday at Belfast Crown Court, accused of murder.

When the case resumed on Thursday, Abdul Wahab pleaded guilty to murder.

The Pakistani national also pleaded guilty to two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent 24 hours before the child's death and on other occasions between July and December that year.

A minimum period, before he can be released, will be set at a future date.

The trial had been told the schoolgirl was tortured and killed in her home - a place where she should have felt safe.

During the opening, Crown barrister Liam McCollum detailed the injuries inflicted on Nadia.

As well as suffering a skull fracture and lacerated liver which caused her death, Nadia had sustained fractures and re-fractures to her ribs, a fractured collarbone, a fractured pelvis and an injury to her bowel.

Also present at Nadia's time of death were 70 surface injuries including bruising and abrasions.

Nadia was rushed to hospital from her home in Newtownabbey

This led the Crown to conclude that Nadia had been subjected to a campaign of physical abuse in the family home which culminated in her death.

As the hearing was due to resume on Thursday, barristers for both Mr and Mrs Wahab asked that their clients be re-arraigned.

At this point Abdul Wahab bowed his head and tearfully pleaded guilty to the murder.

Aleksandra Wahab pleaded guilty to allowing the death of a child and allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.

These pleas were accepted by the court and the jury was discharged.

She was remanded back into custody.

Addressing the jury of seven men and five woman, the judge said that as both defendants had now pleaded guilty to three charges each, he directed them to return not guilty verdicts on all the remaining counts.

A spokesperson for the school said: ""Our school community is still in shock at this terrible tragedy. We have lost Nadia who was a much loved pupil.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted at this time.""

China ""represents a challenge to the world order"" which the UK must take seriously, Rishi Sunak has said.

The prime minister told the BBC he was increasing funding for the armed forces because ""the world has become more volatile"" and ""threats to our security have increased"".

Defence spending will rise by nearly £5bn over the next two years.

But No 10 has given no timeframe for a longer term ambition to boost spending to 2.5% of national income.

Mr Sunak was speaking in California, where he held talks with his US and Australian counterparts to agree details of a UK-US pact to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.

The agreement, known as the Aukus pact, was signed in 2021 as part of a joint effort to counter Chinese military power in the Indo-Pacific region.

Mr Sunak said in a press conference to mark the pact that the Aukus partnership would deliver ""one of the most advanced"" submarines ""the world has ever known"", creating thousands of jobs in British shipyards.

The new SSN-Aukus submarines will also be used by the UK, and will be in operation for the Royal Navy by the late 2030s under the plan.

The boats will replace the UK's seven Astute-class subs.

The UK's submarines will mainly be built by BAE Systems at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, and Rolls-Royce, with the US sharing sensitive technology for the project.

Australia's boats will be built in South Australia, using some components manufactured in the UK, and will be in service in the early 2040s.

Mr Sunak said: ""The Aukus partnership, and the submarines we are building in British shipyards, are a tangible demonstration of our commitment to global security.

""This partnership was founded on the bedrock of our shared values and resolute focus on upholding stability in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.""

Earlier, in an interview with the BBC's Chris Mason, Mr Sunak said: ""China is a country with fundamentally different values to ours and it represents a challenge to the world order.

""And that's why it's right that we are alert to that and take steps to protect ourselves… stand up for our values and protect our interests.""

He said the government took the ""challenge"" posed by China seriously, adding that the UK had taken action including blocking Chinese investment in sensitive sectors like semiconductors.

Pressed on whether the ambition to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income was meaningless without a timeframe, the prime minister said the government should be judged ""on our actions"".

As chancellor, Mr Sunak said he had overseen the largest uplift in defence spending since the end of the Cold War and the government had increased spending every year since then.

""We're one of the largest spenders on defence anywhere in the world, the largest in Europe, and that will continue to remain the case,"" he added.

However, Labour pointed out that defence spending had not hit 2.5% of GDP since it left government in 2010. The UK currently aims to spend 2% of GDP on defence each year, latest figures show.

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy described the ambition as ""another hollow promise"", with ""no plan and no timetable"".

Some Tory MPs have also expressed concern about the level of investment in the armed forces.

Tobias Ellwood, who is chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, said the UK was on a ""peacetime budget"" as the world was ""sliding towards a new Cold War"".

While Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has publicly welcomed the extra £5bn announced by the prime minister, he had been hoping for considerably more.

There had been reports - denied by Mr Wallace - that he had threatened to resign if he did not get a commitment to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030.

Mr Wallace told the Commons he was ""not interested"" in resigning, although he added that he was worried about the increased threats facing the UK and long-term investment was needed.

Hulking floating airports, aircraft carriers, dominate the shoreline on the Pacific Coast of the United States, where there is a gathering of what's known as the Aukus pact: Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, keeping a collectively nervous eye on an increasingly muscular China.

Privately, the government is stark in its assessments.

Western democracies are comparatively and collectively weaker economically as China grows; Beijing can use every instrument of the state as a tool of foreign policy in a way that's impossible in an open democracy.

All the data make us more concerned, not less, as one senior figure put it. The review of foreign and defence policy, which has just been published, says the UK is committed to ""swift and robust action"" to counter any threat to UK national interests from China.

Mr Sunak was also asked whether Chinese-owned social media app TikTok should be banned on all government phones.

It comes after the Sunday Times reported experts at GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre had identified risks to sensitive information from the app and could issue advice to ministers and civil servants.

The prime minister refused to comment directly but said ""we take the security of devices seriously and we look also at what our allies are doing"".

The US government and the European Commission have already taken steps to ban TikTok on the phones of staff members.

The government has set out its plans for foreign and defence policy in an new version of the so-called Integrated Review.

The update was ordered by then-Prime Minister Liz Truss in September last year to take account of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The review identified Russia as ""the most pressing national security and"
125,"foreign policy priority in the short-to-medium term"".

But it also describes China under Communist Party rule as an ""epoch-defining and systemic challenge... across almost every aspect of national life and government policy"".

It says the government will engage ""constructively"" with Beijing on shared priorities but where the Chinese government's actions threaten the UK's interests ""we will take swift and robust action to protect them"".

Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who is among the Tory MPs calling for the government to take a tougher line on China, said he was ""confused"" about what the government's position was.

""Does that now mean that China is a threat or an epoch-defining challenge or a challenging government epoch or none of that?"" he asked in the Commons.

Mr Lammy said the updated review was ""overdue"" but welcome.

""The initiative to improve understanding of China in government is vital, particularly given the Foreign Office has only been training 14 people a year to speak fluent Mandarin,"" he added.

Chris Heaton-Harris spoke to the media after meeting the main Stormont parties

The secretary of state has hit back at accusations that he had set out a ""punishment budget"".

He was responding to claims from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that it was ""wrong for people to punish people of Northern Ireland"".

The secretary of state said Stormont can repay a £300m budget overspend across two years rather than one.

Repaying the 2022-23 overspend over a longer period will ""provide some protection to frontline public services"", he said.

But he added departments still faced difficult decisions ""in order to live within the funding available"".

Stormont officials have been planning for budget cuts of at least £500m in cash terms in this financial year - most Stormont departments will have their budgets cut in cash terms.

""The purpose was not to punish anybody with this budget - it's to make sure services can continue in the absence of devolved government,"" said Mr Heaton-Harris.

Asked what else he could offer the DUP given that its stance on re-entering Stormont has not changed, he replied: ""Let's see where talks lead to.""

DUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson said his party had ""real concerns about the lack of allocations within the budget for pay awards"".

""There are major challenges here and we are concerned about the way the Northern Ireland Office is handling things,"" he said.

""This is what the secretary of state described as a flat budget.

""Of course I want to see Stormont back up and running but it needs to be on a stable foundation.""

He said going back to Stormont was not a ""quick fix"".

The Department of Health, the largest department, is receiving an allocation of £7.25bn for day-to-day spending - similar to the amount it got last year.

This ""flat cash"" funding will likely be viewed as a difficult settlement for the department, given the current high rate of inflation and outstanding pay demands.

Compared with last year's budget figures the amount of money going to Education, Justice and Economy - the biggest spending departments - has been cut slightly in cash terms.

Education will get £2.57bn, down from £2.64bn, Justice will get £1.12bn, down from £1.14bn, while Economy will get £772m, down from £780m.

This budget could have been worse. But make no mistake, it is still likely to mean deteriorating public services for NI citizens.

The blow has been softened a little by allowing last year's £300m overspend to be repaid over two years instead of one.

The repayments will be drawn from any new money sent from Westminster later this year rather than being immediately chopped from departmental funds.

But that will present a significant challenge to the senior civil servants currently running Stormont.

There is an expectation that the UK government will eventually provide extra money to settle public sector pay disputes in England.

That will automatically mean extra funding for Stormont.

But that raises the prospect that the senior officials will then have to tell their workforces that they will not get a pay deal to match England because the overspend comes first.

That is not a recipe for industrial peace.

Mr Heaton-Harris said the overspend would be cleared by using any additional in-year funding from the Treasury.

Should this not cover the full amount, the outstanding balance would be paid in 2024-25 by reallocating money from previously announced Northern Ireland funding packages.

It is understood that the possibility of drawing on a funding stream known as financial transactions capital (FTC) is being considered.

This is a conditional form of capital funding which Stormont consistently underspends.

The Treasury would have to agree that FTC could be used in this way.

No new money-raising policies, such as water charges, were advanced by the Northern Ireland secretary.

He repeated that lower levels of revenue generation but higher public-service provision in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK was ""unsustainable"".

New legislation to allow the UK government to explore options for increasing budget sustainability has also been introduced.

It will work with the Northern Ireland Civil Service to review areas for further revenue raising.

In Belfast on Wednesday people protested against budget cuts

Stormont can expect more money if the UK government allocates new funding to settle public sector pay deals in England.

But if that money must be used to reduce the overspend, it could be very difficult for senior officials to offer similar pay deals to public servants in Northern Ireland unless savings are found in other areas.

Ulster University economist Esmond Birney said the budget presented a tough challenge for the Stormont departments.

He described allowing the overspend to be paid down over two years as being the least worst option, compared to doing it immediately which ""would have implied very large spending cuts in this year"".

On Wednesday the head of Stormont's civil service, Jayne Brady, warned that the ""damage"" caused by the proposed budget reductions would be unprecedented.

Writing to Mr Heaton-Harris's office, she outlined her ""profound concern"" about senior civil servants being placed in ""harmful decision-making positions"" about which services should be cut.

It was a rare and significant intervention, and one not typically made by senior civil servants.

Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the budget would be ""brutal for public services"".

He said civil servants would be put in an ""incredibly difficult position when deciding on how to apply severe cuts"".

He called for a restored executive and a review of how Northern Ireland is financed.

The secretary of state hosted round table talks with parties in Northern Ireland

The Stormont political parties met Mr Heaton-Harris on Thursday afternoon about the budget.

They are not in government due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott of Stormont, which began in February 2022.

Sinn Féin's former Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the budget would devastate public services.

""The absence of an executive is really reprehensible at this stage when this is the outcome for people we represent,"" he said.

Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the budget did not contain ""any flexibility"".

""It's quite grim, if I'm really honest, but it's been put to us and it's difficult to do anything without a government up and running,"" he said.

Alliance Party assembly member Andrew Muir described the discussions as ""grim and truly bleak"".

He expressed concern that it would be left to civil servants to take decisions about cuts and said that was ""entirely wrong"".

Social Democratic and Labour Party assembly member Matthew O'Toole described the meeting with Mr Heaton-Harris as concerning.

He said the budget would mean ""a real squeeze on public services"" imposed on people in Northern Ireland that they did not deserve, ask or vote for.

Permanent secretaries - top civil servants - have been running Northern Ireland's nine departments since October but their powers are severely limited.

They can only implement policies previously agreed by politicians and their ability to react to changing circumstances is negligible.

Departments have been operating without proper budgets since the start of the financial year in April.

The pub closed on 1 May and Mrs R"
126,"yley told a local news website ""I've had enough""

Two former pub managers have given a voluntary interview to Essex Police after their collection of golly dolls was seized by the force.

Five officers removed the offensive dolls from the White Hart Inn in Grays, which has since shut down, following a hate crime allegation.

Essex Police was waiting for landlord Chris Ryley to return from abroad and it confirmed he and wife Benice Ryley were spoken to on Thursday.

A police spokesperson said: ""Two people, a man and woman, have been interviewed voluntarily as part of our investigation.

The police seized the dolls from behind the bar on 4 April and the Campaign for Real Ale removed the pub from its Good Beer Guide the following week.

Mrs Ryley said at the time she had displayed the collection, donated by her late aunt and customers, for nearly 10 years.

The building was vandalised with white paint and had its windows damaged on 16 April - prompting a separate police investigation.

Mrs Ryley closed the pub on 1 May, citing a boycott by brewing companies and the maintenance firm Innserve.

Heineken and Carlsberg both told the couple to stop serving its lager, with Heineken labelling the collection as an ""abhorrent display"".

Admiral Taverns, the company that owned the pub building, said it planned to reopen the venue under new management.

The dolls are thought to date back to the minstrel entertainment shows, when typically white actors painted their faces black and depicted negative stereotypes of black people.

It became a fictional character that appeared in books by Florence Kate Upton in the late 19th Century.

Bank of America has been ordered to pay out $150m (£116m) in penalties after it was found to have opened credit cards without customers' permission.

Regulators also discovered the bank ""double-dipped"" fees from customers and withheld promised reward bonuses.

The violations at the US's second-largest bank affect hundreds of thousands of customers and date back to 2012 in some cases, regulators said.

Bank of America has not admitted or denied the investigation's findings.

The bank has been ordered to refund customers and pay a total of $150m in penalties to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

Customer refunds are expected to be worth more than $80m, the CFPB said.

The regulator said Bank of America illegally applied for and enrolled consumers in credit card accounts without their knowledge or authorisation to help bank employees reach sales incentive goals.

Customers were charged unjustified fees and ""suffered negative effects to their credit profiles"", said the CFPB.

Bank of America is also accused of double-dipping fees that were charged when a customer had insufficient funds in their account.

People were charged $35 when a transaction was declined. But Bank of America allowed fees to be repeatedly charged for the same transaction.

The lender said it has since ended charging the $35 fee for insufficient funds and reduced overdraft fees.

Bank of America also eliminated sales goals for its credit card staff in January 2023, and agreed to keep that change in place for at least three years.

Rohit Chopra, director at the CFPB, said: ""Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent.

""These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust. The CFPB will be putting an end to these practices across the banking system.""

President Joe Biden has pledged to crack down on ""junk fees"" imposed by companies across a range of industries, including sales of concert tickets and airline flights.

He has urged Congress to outlaw certain charges, such as fees for quitting a mobile phone or pay TV service before the contract expires.

Under his direction, the CFPB increased its scrutiny of banks and their customer fees in 2022, soliciting complaints from consumers about practices such as overdraft fees.

The White House has said its push has led to more than $5bn in annual savings for the public, after many banks, including Bank of America, voluntarily eliminated or reduced the charges.

Bank of America said the money it made from overdraft and non-sufficient fund fees has dropped more than 90% as a result of changes made in the first half of 2022.

The bank was fined $20m in 2014 and ordered to pay more than $700m to customers for deceptive marketing and illegal charges related to its credit cards. It was also ordered to pay $225m in penalties last year for botching the distribution of unemployment benefits.

Senior civil servant Sue Gray, who investigated lockdown gatherings in Downing Street, has been offered a job as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff.

A Labour spokesman said Sir Keir was ""delighted"" that ""she hopes to accept the role subject to the normal procedures"".

But allies of Boris Johnson reacted with anger to the news.

Former minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said Ms Gray's Partygate conclusions now looked ""like a left-wing stitch up"".

""So much for an impartial Civil Service, the Gray report now looks like a left-wing stitch up against a Tory prime minister,"" the former business secretary and Brexit opportunities minister tweeted.

A friend of Mr Johnson said Ms Gray's job offer undermined the validity of her investigation into parties held in Downing Street when Covid-19 restrictions were in force.

""What was supposed to be an investigation by independent civil servants is now revealed to have been carried out by someone who ultimately would go on to work for Keir Starmer,"" they said.

Ms Gray herself has yet to comment.

A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that Sue Gray has resigned from the post of Second Permanent Secretary in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). This was accepted by the department Permanent Secretary and Cabinet Secretary with immediate effect.

""We will not be commenting further on individual personnel matters. We are reviewing the circumstances under which she resigned.""

Under the civil service code, officials of Ms Gray's seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment.

The move will be scrutinised by the anti-corruption watchdog, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which will advise the prime minister on whether the move is ""unsuitable"".

Rishi Sunak will make a final ruling, but does not have the power to block an appointment.

Ms Gray went from an influential but little-known arbiter of conduct in government to a household name.

Her report on the Partygate scandal last year contributed to Mr Johnson's downfall as prime minister, prompting numerous Conservative MPs to call on him to resign.

She criticised ""failures of leadership and judgment"" in No 10 and said ""the senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility"".

Separately, Mr Johnson received one of 126 fines issued by the Metropolitan Police while it investigated gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall.

Hearings in an inquiry by the Commons Privileges Committee into opposition claims Mr Johnson misled MPs about what he knew about the lockdown gatherings in government buildings are expected to begin in the coming weeks.

Other key allies of Mr Johnson have been quick to comment.

Former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries tweeted that Ms Gray's reported move to Sir Keir's office was ""not surprising"".

""Whilst writing report, she used QC who tweeted out pro Labour anti gov [government] tweets whilst Alistair Campbell heaped praise upon her. Her comms [communications] assistant briefed against Johnson from day 1.

""The Gray report was a stitch up of PM and CSs [civil servants],"" she said.

Very few civil servants become household names. Sue Gray definitely cleared that bar"
127,".

She was selected to investigate Partygate because of her reputation as an unimpeachable government official.

It's important to stress that Ms Gray taking a political job with Labour doesn't mean she was ever biased in her role as a civil servant. Everyone working in government will have personal views, but they're trusted and expected to serve the ministers of the day.

But her proposed career move does provide allies of Boris Johnson with ammunition to question the legitimacy of her Partygate findings (which were very bad for the former prime minister).

Why are Labour making this appointment? The qualities Sue Gray has largely been associated with - professionalism, propriety and public service - are exactly those they want to project.

And it sends a sign about the party's intentions - Keir Starmer wants to work closely with someone who was (until very recently) a senior civil servant, because he intends to make it to 10 Downing Street.

Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said he was ""genuinely shocked"", and accused Sir Keir of having ""scant regard for the public image of the civil service and the damage this will do"".

""After the events of last year, people will quite understandably be questioning the appropriateness of this appointment, including issues of impartiality,"" he added.

Former civil servant Alex Thomas, who now works for the Institute for Government think tank, said the move would be ""difficult for the civil service"", giving its ""critics a stick"".

""Tricky development for those defending impartiality,"" he added.

Sir Keir Starmer said politicians writing books about Covid and leaking messages was “insulting” and a “ghoulish spectacle”.

He was referencing newspaper claims of leaked messages about former Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

Rishi Sunak paid tribute to health workers, adding the Covid inquiry should do its work rather than him commenting on ""piecemeal bits of information"".

A spokesman for Mr Hancock has said the messages had been ""doctored"" to create a false story which is ""flat wrong"".

Front line staff vacancies account for 75% of those cut

More than 600 vacancies at the Department for Communities (DfC) - including those for front line staff - will not be filled, it has been confirmed.

The decision means there is a risk of slowing down the delivery of benefits for those in need.

The DfC is responsible for benefits, housing, addressing homelessness, arts and culture and sport.

Frontline staff vacancies account for 75% of those cut.

The department said the cuts would be made in order to live within an ""inadequate"" budget.

Arm's length bodies of the DfC and third-party organisations funded by the department will receive a 5% cut to their budgets.

These include the Arts Council, Libraries NI and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive among others.

Councils will receive a £4m cut to the Rates Support Grant compared to the previous year, which will affect seven of Northern Ireland's 11 councils.

The department has also decided to leave four offices in the greater Belfast area.

None of the offices are public facing, meaning services will not be impacted.

The DfC is the largest department in the Northern Ireland Civil Service with more than 9,000 staff.

In taking these decisions, the department said it would be £10m over budget, understood to be a calculated risk which is expected to be managed throughout the year.

Confirming the funding decisions, DfC permanent secretary Colum Boyle said the department had ""sought to mitigate the significant and adverse impact"" of the budget, which he described as ""sub-optimal"".

""Our shared priority remains supporting the most vulnerable and at-risk in our society,"" he said.

""However, difficult decisions had to be made to live within the funding available.""

Funding for homelessness is set to be increased by £2m

The Supporting People programme which helps people live independently in the community has had funding sustained at the same as last year's level.

Discretionary support, which provides emergency financial support for people in crisis situation, will receive £20m funding.

Last year, £40m of discretionary support grants were handed out after significant demand due to the cost of living crisis.

Funding for homelessness is to be increased by £2m (or 8%) compared to last year.

The Affordable Warmth Scheme and Neighbourhood Renewal programmes have also been protected.

In terms of the capital budget, the DfC is facing a £59m (27%) shortfall compared to what was asked for, against a backdrop of record inflation in areas such as construction.

This mean's the budget will not be able to meet the department's target to start 2,000 new social homes this year and is now only expected to achieve 1,470 new starts.

This has, broadly, been a debate focused on policy rather than personality - something summed up when Humza Yousaf said he was ""not going to sit here and slag off colleagues in government"".

He did clash with Kate Forbes over her approach to business, but that was teed up by the audience more than the candidates themselves.

When given the chance, the trio have not sought to land punches on each other. The cross-examination portion of the debate was notably less fiery than in previous events.

That may be in part because yellow-on-yellow attacks are greeted with glee by opposition parties, but it is also a mark of how the candidates have developed their approach.

Rather than seeking to savage Humza Yousaf in the cross-examination section, this time Kate Forbes asked policy-laden questions which promoted her own strengths on economic issues.

Ash Regan brought up gender reform - again, something she sees as a strength of her own campaign.

Humza Yousaf was actually ticked off by Stephen Jardine for talking about his own policies at length when he was meant to be questioning Kate Forbes.

This may be because of the fear that mud thrown now could still be stuck when future elections roll around.

But it may also be because this race uses a single transferable vote system – and in a tight contest, second-preference votes could turn out to be crucial.

It may be more profitable to make friends than to try to knock out opponents entirely.

President Zelensky followed into a press conference by Poland's President Duda and Lithuania's President Nauseda Image caption: President Zelensky followed into a press conference by Poland's President Duda and Lithuania's President Nauseda

Away from the scene in Kramatorsk, the Polish and Lithuanian presidents are in Kyiv to meet their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. We're starting to receive a few remarks from them via the news agencies now - we'll keep you posted.

It's expected that the leaders are today preparing some of the groundwork ahead of a meeting on 11-12 July in Lithuania of Nato members.

The hopes of Ukraine and Sweden to join the Western military alliance are expected to be a key theme. In April, Zelensky accepted an invitation to attend the summit in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. However, he recently told the Wall Street Journal that unless Ukraine is “acknowledged and given a signal in Vilnius"" he did not believe there was any ""point"" in attending.

Sweden had hoped to join by the time of the July summit, but Turkey and Hungary have yet to agree.

It's thought that the deployment to Belarus of troops from the Russian mercenary group Wagner will also be high on Nato's agenda next month.

Distant relatives of US President Joe Biden are looking forward to seeing him back on home soil

""You'd know there's Irish roots in him because he's good craic like.""

That's one Irishman's take on US President Joe Biden, and he would know, being related to him.

Back in 2016, the White House called the Irish Family History Centre, asking it to trace Mr Biden's ancestry ahead of an upcoming visit.

After weeks of searching parish records and land registers it compiled a list of his closest living relatives - many of who knew nothing of the connection.

Enter the Blewitts of Ballina, County Mayo, and the Finnegans of Carlingford, County Louth.

Trips to both counties feature on the US presidents whistle-stop itinerary of Ireland"
128,"and his cousins cannot wait to see him back to cement the connections made during his visit in 2016.

US President Joe Biden is fiercely proud of his Irish heritage

Proud of his Irish heritage, President Biden said he was brought up on stories of the ""faith and fortitude"" of his relatives that left Ireland.

""I grew up in a household where my grandfather and grandmother Finnegan, all my mother's brothers and my father told us about the courage and commitment it took for our relatives to emigrate from Ireland - in the midst of tragedy - to distant shores where they didn't know what awaited them,"" he told RTÉ in 2016.

The Blewitt family are linked to president Biden through his great-great-grandfather Patrick.

The family were aware of their connection to the US politician for decades, and met Mr Biden in 2016.

He made a second visit to Mayo at their invitation in 2017.

According to Joe Blewitt, it was during this trip that he told his Irish cousins he would one day return to Ballina ""as president"".

""Of course I knew it was true.

""He's been in politics all his life - that man was bound to be president so I'm absolutely delighted,"" Mr Blewitt told BBC News NI.

The Blewitts have visited the White House several times, most recently last month for St Patrick's Day.

""It was a surreal, very special day for us... It's just one of those days when [it] goes too fast,"" Mr Blewitt said.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Celebrations broke out across Ballina when Biden's presidential victory was declared

He speaks fondly of the president, describing his distant cousin as a down-to-earth, genuine character with a quick wit.

""He loves jokes... You'd know there's Irish roots in him because he's good craic like.""

True to his word, Mr Biden is set deliver a speech to the people of Ballina on Friday.

""We're all happy to see him... It's great for the country, it really just tightens the close bond between America and Ireland,"" Mr Blewitt added.

Mr Biden's public address will take place outside St Muredach's Cathedral which was constructed using bricks sold by Edward Blewitt in 1828 - 27,000 of them earned him £21 and 12 shillings.

It was this money that afforded the family of 10 to eventually set sail to New York on the SS Excelsior in 1851.

Mr Biden's great-great-great grandfather sold bricks used to build St Muredach's Cathedral in Ballina

About 250km (155 miles) to the east of Ballina in County Louth, the president will link up with the Finnegan side of the family tree.

Owen Finnegan emigrated to the US in 1849.

His family followed a year later and settled in Seneca, New York, with their namesake eventually being passed on to the president's own descendants - one of his grand-daughters is named Finnegan Biden.

Fianna Fáil councillor for the area Andrea McKevitt told BBC News NI that ""the atmosphere is electric"" across the Cooley peninsula as residents prepare to welcome Mr Biden with a sea of stars and stripes.

Ms McKevitt is a distant cousin, related through the president's great-great-grandfather Owen.

Andrea McKevitt said her distant cousin's visit sends a strong message during peace deal anniversary

Andrea McKevitt's family were oblivious to the connection until 2016 when White House officials contacted her uncle to break the news.

""I think at the beginning he thought somebody was joking but then when we had paperwork and started looking into it, it proved to be true indeed,"" she said.

Ms McKevitt was also in attendance at this year's St Patrick's Day celebration at the White House, something she described as a ""pinch-me moment"".

""It was a family event,"" she joked.

""It wasn't until it was over I thought: 'Oh my God, I can't believe that's just happened'

""You're living in a dream nearly for the whole day waiting to go in and when you finally got there it was just amazing.""

An advertisement for passage to new York appears on the front page of the Newry Commercial Telegraph newspaper on 10 April 1849

And through the Finnegans there's a Kearney connection with President Biden's fifth cousin once removed getting an invitation to the White House last month.

Former Ireland international rugby player Rob Kearney was singled out of the crowd, just a day before Ireland beat England to win the Six Nation's Grand Slam, with the president nailing his colours to the mast.

It's expected Mr Biden's engagements in Louth will be on a smaller scale than those on the opposite side of the country in Mayo, but Ms McKevitt insists there is no rivalry between the two counties.

""We're happy to let Mayo run with the big public address. Here in Dundalk we had President Clinton address us in 1998, so we can't get all the limelight,"" she said.

With the president's visit timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, Ms McKevitt said it sends a ""really strong, important message"" to the people of Ireland.

""There was a deal made 25 years ago. It's time for us to keep moving and getting on to the next stage of the peace process,"" she said.

""Hopefully his hand of wisdom and hand of friendship can ensure that more work continues to be done so peace remains on this island.""

BBC chairman Richard Sharp has resigned after breaking rules over dealings with Boris Johnson ahead of his appointment.

A report found Mr Sharp created the appearance of a conflict of interest by not fully disclosing his knowledge of the ex-PM's personal finances.

His position was scrutinised after it emerged he tried to secure a high-level government meeting for a businessman offering Mr Johnson financial help.

Mr Sharp defended his conduct but said he did not want to be a distraction.

A critical report led by barrister Adam Heppinstall was published on Friday, after months of speculation about Mr Sharp's position and a row about BBC independence.

The probe was set up after reports in the Sunday Times revealed Mr Sharp, a close associate of Mr Johnson, had played some role in the PM's personal finances at the same time as he was seeking to secure the senior BBC job.

In late 2020, Mr Sharp sought to arrange a meeting between Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Sam Blyth, a distant cousin of Mr Johnson who had offered to support the PM financially, after reading press claims he was struggling to make ends meet.

The ex-investment banker and Conservative Party donor had already applied for the senior BBC job when he approached Mr Case and was appointed a few months later.

The report found he had failed to disclose two potential perceived conflicts of interest: first, by telling Mr Johnson he wanted to apply for the BBC role before doing so; and second, by telling the PM he intended to set up a meeting between Mr Case, the country's most senior civil servant, and Mr Blyth.

It notes that Mr Sharp does not accept the first conclusion, but he has apologised for the second, though described it as ""inadvertent and not material"".

The report found ""there is a risk of a perception that Mr Sharp was recommended for appointment"" because he sought to assist the PM in a private financial matter ""and/or that"
129,"he influenced the former prime minister to recommend him by informing him of his application before he submitted it"".

It described his involvement in Mr Johnson's private financial affairs as ""very limited"" but concluded that it should have been declared anyway - even though the meeting between Mr Case and Mr Blyth did not subsequently take place.

The report did not make a judgement ""on whether Mr Sharp had any intention of seeking to influence the former Prime Minister in this manner"".

Mr Sharp has previously insisted he believed flagging his BBC application with Mr Case and agreeing to have no further involvement in any loan discussions resolved any conflict of interest issues, and therefore they did not need to be further disclosed - but the report disagreed with his position.

He said he did not play ""any part whatsoever in the facilitation, arrangement, or financing of a loan for the former prime minister"" but that he was quitting in order to ""prioritise the interests of the BBC"".

Mr Sharp conceded that with hindsight he should have disclosed his role in setting up a meeting between Mr Case and Mr Blyth to the appointments panel during the scrutiny process ahead of him taking up the senior role, and he apologised for the ""oversight"".

The details of who said what to who and when are complicated but there is a simple issue, did Richard Sharp tell the full truth when he applied for the job?

He says today's independent report makes clear that he didn't and he was in breach of the rules.

That breach he says was ""inadvertent"" and an ""error"" he regrets - but it matters.

He is the head of the BBC and its reputation is based on trust. The job description for the BBC Chairman says it is essential that they ""observe high standards of openness and seek to maximise transparency and accountability"".

MPs on the Commons Media Select Committee have already criticised Richard Sharp for a lack of openness and transparency for not revealing his role in a loan guarantee to Boris Johnson. These were, they said, ""serious errors of judgment"".

Their report added: ""Mr Sharp has accepted that his failure to disclose this involvement has caused embarrassment to him and the BBC and has potentially been misconstrued, both of which are tests on conflicts that the public appointments process specifically requires candidates to consider.""

It's probably worth quoting here the exact words from the Cabinet Office's Governance Code: ""If you have any interests that might be relevant to the work of the BBC, and which could lead to a real or perceived conflict of interest if you were to be appointed, please provide details in your application.""

The weeks of headlines and the critical conclusions of two reports into his actions have certainly been, in his words, ""a distraction from the Corporation's good work"".

The report also called for an overhaul of the rules around public appointments, and criticised the leaking of ministers' preferred candidates for senior jobs to the media - pointing out there were reports about Mr Sharp being tipped for the BBC role in newspapers before the process was completed.

Mr Sharp's position came under further scrutiny in March following Gary Lineker's suspension over a tweet criticising government asylum policy, a decision which triggered a wider row about BBC impartiality.

Critics of the BBC's handling of the issue contrasted Lineker's suspension with how allegations against Mr Sharp were dealt with, pointing out the chairman was able to remain in post despite ongoing investigations.

Lineker tweeted on Friday the BBC chair should ""not be selected by the government of the day... not now, not ever"".

The BBC chair can only be appointed or sacked by the government. The BBC director general, the executive who has ultimate editorial control over the corporation, does not have the power to remove them.

Responding to the resignation, the BBC's former controller of editorial policy, Richard Ayre, said the matter came down to ""the integrity and transparency"" of Mr Sharp's application and that he ""had to go"".

He continued: ""Meaningfully or not he had done a favour [for Mr Johnson]. He didn't declare that to the assessment panel.""

Tim Davie, director-general of the BBC, said Mr Sharp had made a ""significant contribution to the transformation and success of the BBC"".

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he has not seen the report into Mr Sharp and did not guarantee a non-political figure would replace him.

Speaking to reporters in Glasgow, Mr Sunak said: ""There's an appointments process that happens for those appointments. I'm not going to prejudge that.""

Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said: ""The prime minister should have sacked him weeks ago. Instead it took this investigation, called by Labour, to make him resign.""

Mr Sharp will remain in post until a successor is appointed in June.

Staff sickness in the NHS in England has reached record levels.

Figures for 2022 show an absence rate - the proportion of days lost - of 5.6%, meaning the NHS lost the equivalent of nearly 75,000 staff to illness.

This is higher than during the peak pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 - and a 29% rise on the 2019 rate.

Mental health problems were the most common cause, responsible for nearly a quarter of absences, the Nuffield Trust analysis of official NHS data shows.

Big rises were also seen in cold, coughs, infections and respiratory problems, likely to be linked to the continued circulation of Covid as well as the return of flu last year.

There were three categories covering these types of illnesses. If combined, they would be responsible for more sickness than mental health.

The think tank warned the NHS was stuck in a ""seemingly unsustainable cycle"" of increased work and burnout, which was contributing to staff leaving.

The analysis, exclusively for BBC News, comes ahead of the publication of the government and NHS England's long-awaited workforce plan.

Nuffield Trust senior fellow Dr Billy Palmer said: ""The health service is grappling with a difficult new normal when it comes to staff sickness leave.

""There has been a lot of focus on recruitment but we need more endeavour to improve the working conditions of existing staff and protect them from illness.

""The workforce plan needs to have concrete support to enable employers to improve NHS staff experience if the service is to break this cycle of staff absences, sickness and leaving rates.""

The NHS sickness rate, the highest since records began, in 2010, is above the public sector average of 3.6%.

The Nuffield Trust warned it was likely to be an undercount of the true figure as not every absence would have been recorded.

And while recording systems differed in Wales and Scotland, it was clear those nations were also seeing increased levels of sickness in the NHS.

Miriam Deakin, of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, said the findings ""laid bare the psychological strain on staff"".

She said the absences came on top of 110,000 vacancies in the health service and warned the situation was having a ""knock-on effect on patient care"".

Unison head of health Sara Gorton said the rise in illness was due to the ""unrelenting pressure"" on the NHS.

""Until the NHS has sufficient employees to care for and treat all the people needing its help, absence levels will keep going through the roof. If there's to be a healthy NHS, it first needs a healthy workforce.""

A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said high rates of Covid at the start of 2022 would have had an influence on the figures.

""For those staff that need it the NHS provides physical and mental health support - including targeted psychological support and treatment,"" she added.

A new business lobby council has been formed, boasting some of the UK's largest companies as its founding partners.

The Business Council has been launched by the British Chambers of Commerce (B"
130,"CC) in a bid to ""design and drive the future of the British economy"".

Heathrow, BP, IHG Hotels & Resorts and Drax are among its new members.

It comes as the troubled CBI faces a crunch vote on its future after it was mired in serious sexual allegations.

The CBI has been canvassing opinion from its existing membership on a series of reforms, the result of which will be revealed at a key meeting on Tuesday.

It has received the public backing of 13 companies - including manufacturing giant Siemens and the world's largest computer software firm Microsoft ahead of the vote.

But the new group will be hoping to pick up the support of businesses which cut ties with the CBI - including household names such as John Lewis and BMW.

The BCC works to support and connect tens of thousands of companies in the UK and internationally and is known for putting out a quarterly economic survey.

BCC director general Shevaun Haviland and president Baroness Martha Lane Fox will join business leaders in London on Monday to discuss the work of its new council to represent the interests of UK firms.

""Over the past few months we have been talking to the nation's largest corporates and it has become clear to us they are looking for a different kind of representation,"" Ms Haviland said.

""These businesses want to be part of a framework that's rooted in their local communities, but with the ability to shape the national and international debate,"" she added.

Ms Haviland said the Business Council would focus on an initiative directed at the future of the economy targeting:

The new group will not know until Tuesday how much support its competitor will continue to receive but the CBI's new director general Rain Newton-Smith has described the vote as ""critical"" to its future.

The BBC's business editor Simon Jack said the timing of the announcement from the BCC was hard to ignore, saying the launch represented a ""tussle for the trust of business and the ear of government"".

A CBI source said ""the timing of this is very opportunistic. Business succeeds through a collaborative approach and we find that more effective"".

Over the weekend the Sunday Times newspaper reported that the CBI's last director general Tony Danker was planning to sue his former employer, after he was forced out over the sexual misconduct allegations.

Molly, who has autism, spent several months in a children's ward

A safety investigation has warned that young people with complex mental health needs are being put at significant risk, by being placed on general children's wards in England.

The findings come from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB).

BBC News recently highlighted the plight of a 16-year-old autistic girl, who spent several months in a children's ward.

Other families have since contacted the BBC describing similar situations.

The majority had faced similar difficulties getting appropriate support.Mental health patients 'at risk' in child wards

The HSIB - which is a government-funded body - says that paediatric wards are designed to care for patients who only have physical health needs and not for those with mental health needs.

It describes the situation in 18 hospitals it visited as ""challenging"", and 13 were described as ""not safe"" for children who were suicidal or at risk of harming themselves to be on their paediatric wards.

Hospitals say they are seeing an increasing number of children with a combination of autism, learning disabilities and complex social and mental health needs.

NHS England says it has an ongoing transformation programme to improve mental health services for children and young people, including adapting hospital environments for those with ""sensory needs"".

The HSIB started the investigation after a young patient on a paediatric ward tried to harm themselves and staff.

The child was waiting for a mental health assessment. They managed to abscond from the ward and on two occasions took a drugs overdose.

Two weeks ago, the BBC told the story of 16-year-old Molly who has autism, high levels of anxiety and eating problems.

She spent nearly seven months in a side room on a children's ward at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, because of a shortage of places that could provide her with the support and therapy she needed.

Her family says she found the noisy environment traumatic. Despite having agency mental health nurses watching her 24 hours a day, she ran Mental health patients 'at risk' in child wardsaway from the hospital once and was able to seriously harm herself on a number of occasions. She was also restrained numerous times.

In April, her behaviour became so distressed that the children's ward closed to other patients for 10 days. She was then moved to a mental health unit, where she is doing better.

Her local health and care system said it was ""very sorry"" it had not been able to support her in a more suitable environment, when ""she was most vulnerable"".

Molly's story prompted other families to get in touch with the BBC.

Julie's child, who has autism, spent a year in a side room of a children's hospital at the age of 15. The teenager, who does not want their name used, also has eating problems.

Julie says that her child was made to feel at fault, even though ""they hadn't asked to be there"". She says: ""They'd been put there waiting for something that wasn't coming, and how can you... make a vulnerable child feel that they're just a difficulty and a brat.""

Julie's child who has autism spent a year in the side room of a children's ward

Jo-Ann's 15-year-old daughter is being assessed for autism and mental health difficulties. She is currently in the burns unit at a children's hospital. She has no physical problems for them to treat, but was moved there from the paediatric ward of another hospital. She was admitted after trying to harm herself nearly three months ago.

""She is classed as too vulnerable to go onto a mental health unit,"" Jo-Ann said. ""She has fallen into no man's land.""

She said the NHS and council-run children's services are trying to put together the support her daughter needs at home.

One parent also got in touch describing how terrifying it was for children who were physically very poorly, when there was someone being restrained or who was disruptive on the ward.

It is a mark of HSIB's significant concern about the situation that it decided to publish this interim report, before it has finished its full investigation.

The report said paediatric wards contained many self-harm risks, including ligature points, and that they were busy, noisy places which were unsuitable for children experiencing a mental health crisis, or with sensory needs, for instance, because they have autism.

It found that therapeutic help was limited or non-existent and children deteriorated as a result.

Molly's hospital room - her autism meant she found the noise of the ward traumatic

HSIB said on one paediatric ward there were more than 70 security incidents over three months relating to children with high-risk behaviours. Most involved the young person being physically restrained.

""In just over half of the security incidents reported, the child or young person had been sedated, sometimes requiring multiple attempts (up to seven) for the sedation to become effective,"" it said.

The report said on occasions nearly all the paediatric nursing teams on different wards could be involved in trying to support patients whose behaviour was high risk.

Staff told the investigators they were concerned about the ""negative psychological impact"" it was having on other patients and their families.

HSIB said it saw ""vulnerable and unwell children and babies next to or near a young person who was trying to harm themselves and/or whose behaviour could be violent and aggressive"".

The report says there were many incidents where staff were assaulted, and some hospitals, which were struggling to recruit and retain staff, described their workforce as ""collapsing"".

An NHS England spokesperson said: ""The NHS will be reviewing the concerns raised by HSIB and will consider them as part of ongoing work to improve care for the record number of children and young people with mental health needs that the NHS is treating.

""In some circumstances it can be appropriate for young people to receive mental health care in acute settings, such as for treatment of physical health needs, and to support staff in doing this safely there is a clear framework to follow and an online training platform, while several areas are piloting services that better integrate"
131,"mental and physical health care.""

Pavel Kuzin was killed in Bakhmut amid brutal fighting around the eastern Ukrainian city

Staff sergeant Pavel Kuzin took his position at the machine gun - the only soldier still able to fight. Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured.

Suffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field.

It was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety.

The Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many ""unprecedentedly bloody"" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost.

Pavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position.

Unlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.

""There was a bright flash,"" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. ""I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.""

I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive

It was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead.

Tsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.

Two minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing.

At that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.

The 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.

""The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,"" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. ""Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.""

""They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming.""

Hlabets described them as a suicide squad. Others call them cannon fodder.

Ukrainians are trying to fight off Russia's human wave attacks - similar to tactics used during World War One

A number of videos have been shared on telegram channels recently where newly mobilized Russian soldiers appealed to President Vladimir Putin and the authorities to stop what they called ""illegal orders"" to send them ""to be slaughtered"".

Last month mobilised soldiers from Belgorod posted a video saying that they were sent for an assault mission without proper training. After suffering heavy losses, they said they refused to carry out their orders.

Often these poorly trained soldiers are reportedly forced to keep pushing forward. The assault group Storm of the 5th Brigade of the Russian army said in a video appeal that they couldn't leave their position because of zagryad otryad, or blocking troops - detachments that open fire at their own men who try to retreat.

These wave attacks are similar to World War One tactics, when troops charged the enemy and engaged in close combat. And despite their lack of training and experience, sending newly recruited soldiers to such assaults are bringing some results for Russia, albeit at a very high cost.

Ukrainians expose their positions when they open fire to stop those attacks. That allows Russian artillery to identify the target and destroy it, as happened with Pavel's post.

Also, soldiers at forward positions run out of ammunition while trying to repel numerous wave attacks. They then become an easy target.

That was the risk Pavel knew he faced as he rushed to his Browning machine gun. But as long as he kept firing, his wounded brothers-in-arms had a chance to be rescued.

Tsygan was bleeding in the trench where Pavel had left him. Shrapnel had smashed his pelvis. Another piece had gone through his thigh, and a third had hit his abdomen, ""turning the internal organs upside down"", he said. He was barely conscious.

""I didn't see much, it was all white,"" he said. ""I lay on the snowy ground for two hours and I didn't feel cold or anything.""

Next to him was another wounded soldier. The rescue team on an armoured personnel carrier hastily picked them up as shelling resumed. They didn't even have time to close the hatch, Tsygan says.

By that time, Pavel's machine gun had fallen silent. He died from a head wound: a piece of shrapnel had pierced his helmet.

Commanders of the 206th battalion decided to send a group to retrieve the bodies of Pavel and the other soldiers.

The next day in the evening, three groups of two soldiers each set off to bring the bodies back.

""The plan looked good on paper, but things quickly went wrong,"" junior sergeant Vasyl Palamarchuk, who was in the lead group, remembers. They got lost and nearly ran into Russian positions in the dark. When they got close to the dugout, Russians spotted them and opened fire from a tank.

Pavel Kuzin died holding off Russian attackers so his wounded fellow soldiers could be evacuated

Russian tanks and artillery had continuously shelled that post in those days, but the Ukrainian big guns had largely stayed quiet. The reason was a massive shortage of shells.

""Once we counted that the Russians had fired up to 60 shells a day, whereas we could allow only two,"" Palamarchuk explains. ""They destroyed trees and everything else and you had no place to hide.""

Ukraine is struggling to find ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery. Getting shells for weapons donated by Ukraine's western partners has its own limits. As the secretary general of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently: ""The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production.""

Palamarchuk's group eventually picked up Pavel's body just a few hours before Russian troops seized the area. Heavy snow turned into a freezing rain. After numerous breaks on the way back, crawling through craters left by shells, they finally arrived. The whole operation over just a kilometre's distance lasted for six hours.

It was past midnight but the entire battalion gathered at the evacuation point to pay their respects to Pavel, who is survived by his daughter and wife.

""It was a huge loss for our unit,"" Palamarchuk says. ""He saved two people but died himself.""

More than a quarter of patients on antidepressants in England - about two million people - have been taking them for five years, the BBC has found.
"
132,"
This is despite there being limited evidence of the benefits of taking the drugs for that length of time.

A doctor who runs an NHS clinic helping people off the pills says withdrawal symptoms can make it hard for some to stop taking their medication.

Withdrawal guidance was updated in 2019, but he says little has changed.

More than eight million people in England are on antidepressants - which are prescribed for depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder and other conditions. That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show.

The new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason.

The investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.

Modern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.

They were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.

The NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication.

""Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,"" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

""I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.""

But she added: ""People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.""

There has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term.

But on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.

And there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.

Withdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to.

Taking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.

The symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.

Panorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.

A copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what the drug company would tell regulators in Norway.

""We should not volunteer to describe the withdrawal symptoms, but have an agreed list prepared in case they insist,"" the memo says.

Some of the withdrawal reactions the memo refers to include sensory disturbances, sweating, nausea, insomnia, tremors, agitation and anxiety.

Pfizer no longer produces sertraline. Responding to Panorama's findings, a spokesperson said the company ""monitored and reported all adverse event data"" to licensing authorities, ""in line with its legal and regulatory obligations and updated sertraline labelling as required.""

It added: ""Public health organisations and professional medical bodies throughout the world have recognised sertraline and other SSRIs as the treatment of choice for adult depression."" The company said the drug's label warned about withdrawal and had been updated ""as required"".

The Royal College of Psychiatrists published updated information on withdrawal in 2019 - overseen by Prof Burn, who was its president at the time. It came after she heard testimony from patients who had experienced severe withdrawal effects.

Until then, guidance used by the NHS and the college maintained withdrawal was mostly mild and short-lived - lasting no more than about a week.

Now NHS guidance reflects that it can be severe and longer-lasting for some, and withdrawal can last many months.

A Royal College of Psychiatrists spokesperson told the BBC: ""Medicine continuously evolves, as does our knowledge of treating mental illness. As a result, the college updates its guidance when new evidence comes to light.""

A lack of awareness about withdrawal difficulties has meant that even medical professionals who prescribe the drugs have struggled to stop taking antidepressants themselves.

Dr Mark Horowitz, who tried to stop the antidepressants he had taken for 15 years in 2015, said: ""It led to complete havoc in my life,"" he says. ""I would wake up in the morning in full panic, like I was being chased by an animal.""

The panic he felt would last until late into the evenings and he took up running as a distraction.

""I ran until my feet bled, because it gave me a slight reprieve from that panic sensation.""

He said it was worse than the symptoms that led him to take antidepressants in the first place.

Panorama examines whether the current generation of antidepressant drugs have lived up to their promises, following patients who have suffered serious side effects.

He is concerned that far more work has been done on how to start patients on antidepressants - and much less on stopping.

""To me, it's the same as allowing cars to be sold without brakes,"" he said.

""We should know how to start the car and how to stop it.""

Now Dr Horowitz runs England's only NHS antidepressant deprescribing clinic - a pilot scheme set up in London in 2021 to help people struggling to stop taking their medication.

At the moment he is seeing about 25 patients.

Despite withdrawal guidance having been updated, Dr Horowitz thinks patients are still struggling to get tailored advice. Guidance for doctors now recommends that people reduce the dose of their medication in stages, but it does not specify how long it should take. It's different for everyone.

Dr Horowitz is still trying to reduce his antidepressant dose - and hopes to stop altogether this year

The Royal College of GPs told Panorama that family doctors were ""highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations"" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants.

""Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,"" it said it was, ""increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.""

The companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective.

They said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions.

As with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information. They added that their drugs are considered to be safe, with a positive benefit-risk ratio by doctors, patients and regulators around the world.

The Irish delegation raised concerns at a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference

The British and Irish governments have clashed over the UK's controversial bill dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

It happened during a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London (BIIGC) on Monday.

It is understood Irish delegation raised concerns over the impact on investigations into loyalists attacks in the Republic of Ireland.

The BIIGC was set up by the Good Friday Agreement and meets twice a year.

The UK government's legislation on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland offers a conditional amnesty to those accused of killings and other Troubles-related crimes.

It has been criticised by victims' groups, the Irish government and political parties at Stormont.

Micheál Martin said both governments need to work together on the issue of legacy

On Monday, it is understood the UK government was challenged on how its plan to end all police investigations as part of its legacy bill will affect ongoing Garda (Irish police) investigations into loyalist attacks.

Irish government representatives highlighted both the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974 when 33 people were killed and also the loyalist bomb attacks in Belturbet, County Cavan, in 1972 when two teenagers were fatally injured.

Last year Gardaí released two photofit images of a suspect in the Belturbet attacks as part of its cross-border investigation.

Speaking at a press conference, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said both governments needed to work together on the issue of legacy.

He said he had an issue with people being granted immunity.

""We have fundamental concerns about the legislation currently before parliament,"" Mr Martin told the BIIGC press conference.

""We don't believe it is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights,"" he added.

Chris Heaton-Harris said there was a ""complete agreement"" on the need for a restored executive

Meanwhile, the Stormont stalemate was top of the agenda at the meeting for Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.

He said both governments were in ""complete agreement"" on the need for the restoration of the Northern Ireland executive.

Mr Heaton-Harris said the local election results highlighted that the people of Northern Ireland wanted restoration as well.

Sinn Féin emerged as the biggest party in both local government and the Stormont assembly following recent elections.

Last week, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the UK government was well aware of his party's concerns on the protocol which needed to be addressed before a return to Stormont.

Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill called on the DUP to clarify what it has asked the government for in relation to the working of the NI Protocol.

Ms O'Neill said it was ""unacceptable"" that the DUP seemed to be holding private discussions with the government.

Asked about Monday night's Commons debate on the privileges committee report that found former PM Boris Johnson misled parliament, Ms O'Neill said she would not comment on how MPs should vote but said ""Boris Johnson has been a disaster from start to finish"".

MPs later voted by a margin of 354 to seven to approve the report.

The BIIGC is one of the few such bodies unaffected by the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott of Stormont.

Mr Heaton-Harris's number two, Steve Baker, and Irish Justice Minister Helen McEntee were also at the meeting.

The meeting was held as talks continued between the UK government and the DUP.

It is understood the party is looking for changes to the legislation governing the Northern Ireland Protocol as well as further constitutional guarantees.

Last week Mr Heaton-Harris caused raised eyebrows when he said he did not know what the DUP was asking for - a view contradicted by the party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.

On Friday, at a meeting of the British Irish Council in Jersey, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said he was sure Mr Heaton-Harris would ""listen respectfully"" to the DUP's position.

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said his government could only play a supporting role.

Ed Sheeran had his account hacked and music sold online by Adrian Kwiatkowski

A hacker who stole two unreleased songs from Ed Sheeran and sold them on the dark web has to pay more than £100,000.

Adrian Kwiatkowski, 23, from Ipswich, traded the music by Sheeran and 12 songs by rapper Lil Uzi Vert in exchange for cryptocurrency.

Last year, he admitted 19 charges, including copyright infringement and possessing criminal property, and was jailed for 18 months.

About half of the money he has to pay is currently held in Bitcoin.

Kwiatkowski managed to get hold of them after hacking the performers' digital accounts, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

He had made £131,000 from the music, City of London Police said.

In his police interview, Kwiatkowski admitted he had hacked the musicians' cloud-based accounts and sold the songs online.

Adrian Kwiatkowski was jailed for 18 months last year for hacking the musicians' accounts

During his trial, Ipswich Crown Court heard that when the defendant's Apple Mac laptop was searched, 565 audio files, including the songs by Sheeran and Vert, were uncovered.

The same court has now granted a confiscation order against the hacker, giving him three months to pay £101,053, after proceedings brought by the Police Intellectual Crime Unit (PIPCU) at City of London Police.

The amount is made up of £51,975 held in a bank account owned by Kwiatkowski and 2.64 BTC (Bitcoin), worth £49,528, which makes it the first confiscation order of cryptocurrency secured by PIPCU.

If the payment is failed to be made within three months, he will face a further 18 months imprisonment.

Det Con Daryl Fryatt from PIPCU said: ""Kwiatkowski executed a complex scheme to sell creative content that he did not own.

""Our work doesn't just stop at conviction, and this result means that Kwiatkowski will not be able to benefit any further from the money he earned through criminal activity.""

""Sadly, unlicensed breeders often prioritise profit over animal welfare,"" said Caerphilly councillor Philippa Leonard

Illegal breeders have been convicted of keeping dozens of dogs in ""appalling"" conditions in a family home.

Julie Pearce, 57, and her daughters Rosalie Pearce, 33, and Kaylie Adams, 24, received suspended sentences after admitting unlicensed dog breeding.

The two daughters were also sentenced for failing to protect 54 dogs from pain, suffering, injury and disease.

The women, of Glyn Terrace, Bargoed, Caerphilly county, are now disqualified from owning animals for 10 years.

Cardiff Crown Court heard the women had been breeding and selling puppies from their home since 2019.

Caerphilly council and RSPCA inspectors found the animals were kept in a ""filthy environment"", contaminated with faeces and urine, at the family's home.

Most dogs had to be shaved as their coats were so matted with faeces and urine

Evidence showed between March 2020 and March 2022 a total of 27 litters of puppies were born and up to 28 breeding bitches were kept on the premises.

The council said a conservative estimate for the profit made from selling the dogs was calculated to be in excess of £150,000

Dozens of dogs were found in ""appalling"" conditions"

Sara Rosser of dog charity Hope Rescue, which took the dogs in after the council's investigation, said it was ""shocking to see so many dogs living in such awful conditions"".

""The majority needed to be completely clipped off by our staff at the centre because their coats were so matted in faeces and urine and many were covered in fleas,"" she said.

Bunny, pictured with Hope Rescue's Sara Rosser, was one of the dogs rescued

""We are pleased to say that all of the dogs have now gone on to find wonderful homes where they have become much loved family members and able to live the lives they deserve,"" added Ms Rosser.

Caerphilly councillor Philippa Leonard said: ""Sadly, unlicensed breeders often prioritise profit over animal welfare.

""Unlicensed dog breeding is a serious matter and it is hoped that the outcome of this case will serve as a strong deterrent to those who operate in this manner.""

The three women have been banned from owning, keeping or transporting all animals for 10 years

Julie Pearce received a year's suspended sentence and was ordered to complete 8 days of rehabilitation activity.

Kaylie Adams and Rosalie Pearce both received a 66-week suspended sentences and were ordered to complete 100 hours each of unpaid work.

Kaylie Adams was also ordered to complete eight days of rehabilitation activity.

The policy is aimed at cutting the number of flats in the city that are used as short-term holiday lets

A plan to regulate Airbnb-style lets in Edinburgh has been ruled unlawful by a judge less than four months before it was due to come into force.

Operators and landlords opposed to the scheme took the city council to court last month.

After a two-day hearing at the Court of Session, Lord Braid agreed that part of the proposal was unlawful.

The decision was hailed as a ""victory for law and common sense"" by the group that brought the case.

The council wants to introduce the licensing scheme in response to concerns about the high number of short-term lets in the capital - particularly in the city centre.

It argues that the lettings have exacerbated housing shortages and fuelled anti-social behaviour.

Hosts have until 1 October to apply for a licence, with people who list whole properties on sites such as Airbnb also needing to apply for planning permission.

Renting out a room in your own home, or letting your home while on holiday, would still be allowed.

Opponents of the scheme raised £300,000 through crowdfunding for a judicial review at the Court of Session, which was said to be largest amount raised for a case in the UK.

The case centred on a presumption against allowing entire flats within tenement blocks to be used as holiday lets unless their owners could demonstrate why they should be exempt.

Lord Braid ruled that the presumption was unlawful and that the lack of provision for temporary licences and requirement for some hosts to supply floor coverings went beyond the council's powers.

He said the policy was unlawful because it breached existing laws on what licensing authorities could do under the law.

The judge wrote: ""It is not the function of the respondent's licensing authority to decide that a licence should not be granted because a property is of a particular type or is in a particular area.

""For the respondent to adopt a normal practice of not granting an short term licence for premises in a tenement, even where planning permission had been granted, is irrational and contrary to the purposes of the overall statutory scheme.

""It would be perverse and oppressive for the respondent, upon receipt of a licensing application, to require an applicant to obtain planning permission for a tenement property; and thereafter, planning permission having been obtained, to refuse the licence for no other reason than that the property was in a tenement.""

The Scottish government says that in certain areas - particularly tourist hot spots - high numbers of lets can cause problems for neighbours and make it harder for people to find homes to live in.

Supporters of the licensing scheme say short-term lets are causing a housing shortage and increasing anti-social behaviour in the capital

Council leader Cammy Day said he made ""absolutely no apology for seeking to protect our residents"" despite the ruling.

He added: ""It is no secret that we face unique housing pressures here in Edinburgh, with a small but densely populated city centre and fast growing population, and it's crucial for us to strike the right balance between promoting our visitor economy while looking after the people that live here all year round.

""Our residents have told us that, in many cases, short-term lets are hollowing out their communities, reducing housing supply and increasing housing costs.

""We can't forget that many have endured years of disturbance and anti-social behaviour and we will continue to work hard to get this right.""

Mr Day said the court had ""acknowledged our intention to find a solution to this and agreed that it was legitimate to use both planning and licensing policy"", with the council now considering its next steps.

A statement issued by the petitioners in response to the judgement said they hoped it would lead the council and government to ""seek a fresh approach that aims to collaborate and work with local operators of self-catering accommodation, recognising the many good things it brings to the economy and people of Scotland"".

It added: ""As the largest crowdfunded case in the history of the UK, the petitioner team are deeply grateful to the many small, local businesses that supported the campaign financially in such uncertain times.

""That grass roots support made it possible for us to take this action, challenging both licensing and planning surrounding short-term lets in Edinburgh and the potential wider impact across urban and rural Scotland.""

Fiona Campbell, chief executive of the Association of Scotland's Self-Caterers, welcomed the ruling, which she said would also have ramifications for other licensing schemes across Scotland.

She said: ""The Scottish government need to go back to the drawing board on short-term let regulation and engage constructively with industry to provide a regulatory framework that works for all stakeholders.""

The proposals were approved by the council's planning committee last year after 88% of the 5,600 people who responded to a consultation on the proposals supported the introduction of the licensing scheme.

Eilidh Keay from tenants' union Living Rent Edinburgh said the decision ""demonstrates how a small group of people can use their money and power to weaponise the legal system to their advantage"".

She said: ""This flies completely in the face of democracy and the will of the people.

""Edinburgh needs homes, not holiday lets. In coming down in support of short-term let operators, this decision seems to have forgotten that Edinburgh is in the midst of a housing crisis.

""It is disgusting that the profit of short-term let operators should be put before the needs of tenants, residents and communities for homes.""

The UK is sending 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv to aid Ukrainians in the fight against Russia

President Vladimir Putin has said Russia would be ""forced to react"" if the UK sent shells made with depleted uranium to Ukraine.

He accused the West of deploying weapons with a ""nuclear component"".

The UK Ministry of Defence confirmed it would provide Kyiv the armour-piercing rounds alongside Challenger 2 tanks but insisted they had a low radiation risk.

Depleted uranium ""is a standard component and has nothing to do with nuclear weapons"", the MoD said.

""The British Army has used depleted uranium in its armour piercing shells for decades,"" the statement added.

""Russia knows this, but is deliberately trying to disinform. Independent research by scientists from groups such as the Royal Society has assessed that any impact to personal health and the environment from the use of depleted uranium munitions is likely to be low.""

Former British Army tank commander - and chemical weapons expert - Col Hamish de Breton-Gordon, said Mr Putin's comments were ""classic disinformation"".

He said depleted uranium rounds used by Challenger 2 tanks contained only trace elements of depleted uranium.

He added it was ""laughable"" to suggest depleted uranium rounds were in any way linked to nuclear weapons, which uses enriched uranium.

Depleted uran"
135,"ium is what is left over after natural uranium has been enriched, either for weapons-making or for reactor fuel.

It is mildly radioactive in its solid form. But it is a very heavy substance, 1.7 times denser than lead, and it is used to harden rounds so that they can penetrate armour and steel.

When a weapon made with a depleted uranium tip or core strikes a solid object, like the side of a tank, it goes straight through it and then erupts in a burning cloud of vapour.

The vapour settles as dust, which is poisonous and also weakly radioactive.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said sending depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine would mean the UK was ""ready to violate international humanitarian law as in 1999 in Yugoslavia"".

""There is no doubt this will end badly for London,"" Mr Lavrov added.

On Tuesday evening, a spokesman for the Pentagon said the US would not be sending any munitions with depleted uranium to Ukraine.

Shells with depleted uranium were used in Iraq and the Balkans, where some claim it was linked to birth defects.

A 2022 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report said depleted uranium was an environmental concern in Ukraine.

""Depleted uranium and toxic substances in common explosives can cause skin irritation, kidney failure and increase the risks of cancer,"" it said.

""The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is considered a more significant issue than the possible impacts of its radioactivity,"" it added.

A scene from ""Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey""

A new Winnie the Pooh horror movie will not be released in Hong Kong and Macau, its distributor has said.

VII Pillars Entertainment apologised for the ""disappointment and inconvenience"" to viewers in the Chinese special administrative regions.

The film was released in the US in February and across the UK in March.

References to the original, family-friendly version of Winnie the Pooh have been used to protest against President Xi Jinping in recent years.

The meme began after an image showing China's President Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama began circulating in 2013.

Censors in China have since clamped down on references to AA Milne's character, and the 2018 Christopher Robin film was banned in the country.

This meme showing Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama began circulating in 2013

Hong Kong's Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration denied the film had been censored, saying it had issued a certificate of approval for the horror movie.

The office told Reuters it would not comment on commercial decisions made about the movie.

The film's director Rhys Frake-Waterfield told Reuters: ""The cinemas agreed to show it, then all independently come to the same decision overnight. It won't be a coincidence.

""They claim technical reasons but there is no technical reason. The film has showed in over 4,000 cinema screens worldwide. These 30-plus screens in Hong Kong are the only ones with such issues.""

The horror movie has received a score of just 4% on film rating site Rotten Tomatoes. It depicts the bear, known for being kind and honest, as a vengeful axe wielding half-man, half-bear.

It went viral online when the trailer was released.

Frake-Waterfield was able to make the film when the 95-year copyright on Milne's first Winnie the Pooh story elapsed in the US in January last year.

But Disney - which bought some licences in the 1960s - still owns certain rights. Trademark laws mean the bear cannot wear a red T-shirt in the horror film, for example.

""We weren't allowed to have him say things like 'oh bother' either,"" Frake-Waterfield told BBC Culture last month.

""There are these elements where we need to be careful not to encroach on their brand and their territory because that's not the intention.

""The intention isn't just to steal their copyright and use it for our own purposes. It's to go from something which is possible to use because it's now publicly available, and just go off on an extreme tangent from that point and make this horrific alternative version to him.""

Labour has ruled out introducing a self-ID system to allow people to change their legal sex without a medical diagnosis.

Leader Sir Keir Starmer has previously said his party would introduce such a system if it wins power.

But shadow women and equalities secretary Anneliese Dodds has now said medical diagnosis upholds ""confidence in the system"".

She added that the requirement also helps people access NHS support.

In a article for the Guardian, she wrote that Labour would streamline the current medical diagnosis rules, calling them ""demeaning"".

The new Labour position appears to be a compromise that has emerged from a party event in Nottingham over the weekend to discuss policy.

It opens up a split with Scottish Labour, which has previously voted to remove the medical diagnosis requirement and has since confirmed it ""continues to support the de-medicalisation of the process in Scotland"".

Under current rules, people who want to change legal sex need to provide a medical report showing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.

This is defined by the NHS as a ""sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity"".

Applicants also have to provide evidence of living full time in their acquired gender for at least two years.

Some campaigners say the the requirement is excessively bureaucratic and invasive, and have long argued for a non-medical process - known as self-identification - instead.

The government ruled out adopting this approach in 2020 after a consultation, but has reduced the fees and moved the process online.

Labour pledged to introduce a self-identification system under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn and the policy was in the party's 2019 general election manifesto.

Sir Keir reaffirmed the 2019 manifesto commitment to ""introduce self-declaration"" in a June 2021 video for LGBT website Pink News.

However, Ms Dodds has now confirmed that the party would keep the need for a gender dysphoria diagnosis, calling it an ""important part"" of the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate.

""Requiring a diagnosis upholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system,"" she wrote.

She said that it also helped refer trans people into the NHS for support services, citing low levels of awareness about how to access them.

She added that Labour wanted to avoid the ""mistakes"" made by the Scottish government, whose new law to ditch medical reports is subject to an ongoing legal wrangle with the UK government.

Scottish ministers' legislation - endorsed by Scottish Labour in the Scottish Parliament - showed a ""cavalier approach"", she added.

However, she added the current requirement to apply to an ""anonymous"" panel to obtain a certificate should be replaced, calling it ""demeaning for trans people and meaningless in practice"".

Instead, she said it ""should be enough"" for registrars to sign off the application, based on diagnosis from one doctor.

The LGBT+ Labour group said the party's new position would be a ""huge step forward"" for trans people over the current government stance.

But it added the party was ""signalling a retreat on their policy of de-medicalised self-ID for the trans community at the next general election"".

Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a patron of the group, told the BBC it would push for further changes, including giving non-medical professionals such as social workers the power to ""externally verify"" someone's acquired gender.

Rosie Duffield, who had threatened to quit as a Labour MP over the party's previous stance, said she welcomed the retention of medical reports, calling it the ""core thing"" demanded by women's groups.

Ms Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, has opposed self-ID as a way for trans people to gain access to single sex spaces such as domestic violence refuges and prisons.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she called for more clarity on the party's position ahead"
136,"of the general election, expected next year, adding it still included a ""bit of confusion and a bit of fence-sitting"".

Women and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said Labour's new position is a ""copy and paste"" of the government's position.

Adding that some Labour MPs had previously attacked the Conservative position as prejudiced, she accused the party of ""bare-faced hypocrisy"".

Heathrow Airport has said that some passengers may face security delays over the Easter holidays due to strike action over pay.

Hundreds of security officers in the Unite union, who work for Heathrow Airport, have begun 10 days of industrial action.

It threatens disruption at the UK's largest airport at the start of the Easter school holidays.

However, Heathrow said the airport was operating ""as normal"" on Friday.

The strike involves security guards at Terminal 5, which is only used by British Airways, and those who check cargo. Unite has accused the airport of a real-terms wage cut.

Heathrow said it had offered a 10% pay increase back-dated to 1 January, plus a lump sum payment of more than £1,000.

The airport said contingency plans were keeping the airport operating as usual.

However, British Airways cancelled about 70 flights on Friday. This included flights already removed from the schedule due to the strikes, and cancellations for other reasons, such as bad weather and an air traffic control strike in France.

Picket lines were mounted outside the airport and Unite said the strike was being ""well supported"".

Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC ""many"" security staff had chosen to work on Friday, but ""a lot"" of agency security staff had been brought in, alongside ""hundreds"" of managers who were ""here to help"".

""The airport is operating as normal,"" he said.

Are you a security officer striking at Heathrow, or a passenger concerned about your travel plans being disrupted? Share your experiences.

The next few days are expected to be busy as people get away on Easter holidays.

Ahead of the strike, Heathrow asked airlines to stop selling tickets and allow customers to change travel dates.

British Airways pre-emptively cancelled 300 flights and Virgin Atlantic confirmed it had limited new ticket sales and introduced a flexible policy.

The strike reduces the number of security staff available to the airport on what is normally a very busy weekend.

Heathrow said it was deploying 1,000 extra colleagues and its management team to assist passengers.

Travellers should check their flight before travelling to the airport, arriving at Heathrow no earlier than two hours before short-haul flights and three hours before long-haul flights, and be ready for security, the airport said.

Passengers will only be permitted to go through security with two items of hand luggage to help the flow.

The aviation industry more broadly is under pressure from the government and the industry regulator to avoid a repeat of last year's Easter's queues, delays and cancellations, which were largely caused by staff shortages.

A leaked letter to businesses from the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport, seen by the BBC, says it would be unacceptable for consumers to face the same level of disruption this year.

Airlines and airports have told the BBC they are confident of having enough staff in place this time round, although external factors such as strikes in France affecting air traffic control could cause issues.

The Empire Pool and trolley buses - two sights no longer seen in Cardiff

Some of the last traces of arguably the biggest event ever to be hosted in Wales are set to disappear.

With 1,130 athletes from 35 countries descending on Cardiff, experts believe the country may never see the like of the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games again.

Little remains of the venues used, with the Sophia Gardens Pavilion demolished in 1982 and the Empire Pool in 1998.

The velodrome at Maindy could soon be bulldozed too under plans.

It is the last remnant of an event sports author Huw Richards believes trumps the 1999 Rugby World Cup as the biggest hosted here.

""As soon as you set foot in the Arms Park, and saw the gathering of elite athletes from all over the globe, you could feel a sense that Wales had become a grown-up member of the world community,"" is how cultural historian Prof Peter Stead described the games.

For younger generations, Maindy Velodrome is best known for nurturing some of Wales' greatest cycling talents, including 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas.

But it is also where riders battled it out for gold in 1958.

Under proposals, an expansion of Cathays High School would see the velodrome lost, and a new track built at Cardiff Bay.

British cyclist Ray Booty waves as he gets the chequered flag to win the 120 miles road race - which started and finished in St Brides Major, Vale of Glamorgan

The club that uses it, Maindy Flyers, said the prospect of ""being left with nothing for future generations of cyclists"" was ""unacceptable"".

Cardiff council replied by saying it fully understands the site's ""historic nature"", but the new velodrome had the support of the national governing body for cycling.

Cardiff Central station remains - but the frontage looked a bit different in 1958

Similar pain was felt by the swimming community when another of the venues from 1958 disappeared.

The Empire Pool had 1,722 seats, diving boards and the country's only 50m pool - but was flattened as the Millennium Stadium rose up to dominate the city centre in the late '90s.

""The Empire Pool was an iconic facility in the heart of the capital that not only opened its doors to the world at the 1958 Empire Games, but also served to develop some of our nation's finest athletes,"" said Swim Wales' head of aquatics and inclusion Sioned Williams.

""To lose this piece of history was a big blow to the Welsh aquatics community.""

However, she said its replacement, the Wales National Pool in Swansea has become a ""thriving hub"" for its elite programme and events, while there is also now an Olympic-sized pool in Cardiff Bay.

Opening ceremony for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Cardiff Arms Park

Coming three years after Cardiff was confirmed as capital, the 1958 games were ""a significant moment"" for the nation, according to sports historian Huw Richards.

But he added: ""It has to be remembered that they were rather smaller than they have since become - with just over 1,100 athletes in 94 events, compared to 5,000 competing in 280 at the most recent games in Birmingham.""

Cardiff Arms Park was where the drama on the track unfolded - but it looked very different then, a 60,000-capacity stadium where Cardiff RFC and the national rugby side played.

A series of redesigns means it now holds 12,500, with the only remaining parts the Gwyn Nicholls Memorial Gates - erected in 1949 to commemorate one of Wales' greatest rugby players.

The Empire Pool and other buildings were demolished as the new Millennium Stadium - now the Principality Stadium - rose up on the banks of the River Taff in the mid '90s

It stands in the shadow of the Principality Stadium next door, the site of which has also undergone massive transformation since 1958.

Work on a new National Stadium began in 1969, with it not officially opened until 1984.

But just 11 years later, it was decided to demolish it for a super-stadium to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.

This tournament is the main rival to the 1958 games as Wales' biggest ever event - but comparisons do not stand up to scrutiny, according to Mr Richards.

""In 1999, Wales was the host of record, staging the opening game and the final, but the event was spread evenly across all of what were then the five nations,"" he added.

""Wales had only nine games out of 41. The other four nations got"
137,"eight each and the most memorable of them, the two semi-finals, were both at Twickenham.""

He said this makes it ""all the odder"" Wales is the only nation to build a new stadium for a Rugby World Cup.

A recent poll on European membership is something most people are familiar with - votes from another were counted at the Sophia Gardens Pavilion in 1975

Sophia Gardens Pavilion, which hosted boxing and wrestling in 1958, was also a concert venue, with Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix among those appearing.

However, its end came in 1982 after its roof collapsed under heavy snow.

Shirley Bassey returned home to perform at the Sophia Gardens Pavilion in November 1961

There is one location used for the 1958 Cardiff-hosted event that remains untouched - and it is 170 miles (274 km) away.

Rowing took place on Llyn Padarn in Eryri, also known as Snowdonia.

Llyn Padarn in Eryri: One location for the 1958 games is in no danger of falling victim to redevelopments in Cardiff

Other big events to come to Wales include golf's Ryder Cup, a Champions League final and an Ashes test - but they were far shorter.

Tourism consultant Prof Terry Stevens believes if Wales was to host the Commonwealth Games again, it would probably be in collaboration with other nations.

""What used to be fairly straightforward, a cycle, is far more complicated now,"" he said.

""It's not just money, there are lots of other objectives of the organisers, plus TV deals. It used to be done on a 'your turn next' basis. Now it's much more nuanced, sophisticated.

""If you go back 15 years, relatively few venues could hold these big events. Now, every city has at least one decent venue - it's incredibly competitive.""

Mr Stevens said sporting bodies increasingly wanted events hosted by multiple countries, such as the next World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

This puts the bid of the UK nations and Ireland for Euro 2028 in a strong position, he believes, especially considering its rival Turkey is going solo.

""It doesn't prevent Wales going alone for one-off games like the Champions League or a golf competition with one course,"" he added.

""The trend is Wales would have to collaborate to host the Commonwealth Games. It doesn't deny us, it's just a different model.""

Manchester City's long quest to win the Champions League finally ended in triumph against Inter Milan in Istanbul as Pep Guardiola's side completed the Treble.

After winning the Premier League and FA Cup, City emulated Manchester United's triple trophy haul in 1999 as they became only the second English club to achieve the feat after Rodri's crisp 68th-minute strike settled an attritional final.

Guardiola's all-conquering side were never at their best against a brilliantly organised Inter and had to cope with the loss of Kevin de Bruyne to injury in the first half.

But the massed ranks of City fans inside Ataturk Stadium did not care about that as they joyously celebrated the greatest night - and season - in the club's history.

And for Guardiola, it seals his status as one of the managerial greats as he added a third Champions League to the two he won at Barcelona, the last coming in 2011.

This was never the walkover many predicted and City had to survive a few scares when Federico Dimarco's header bounced off the bar and Ederson made a stunning late save to deny Romelu Lukaku but ultimately this was all about the victory.

Now Guardiola and his players can take their place in history.
• None Have your say on Man City's performance here

The Champions League has brought suffering to City and Guardiola - especially when they lost to Premier League rivals Chelsea in the 2021 final - but all the pain disappeared just before midnight on a sultry night in Istanbul.

City survived late anxiety, especially when Inter substitute Lukaku headed straight at Ederson with the goal at his mercy, but there was an explosion of joy on the pitch and in the stands at Ataturk Stadium as they finally secured the giant trophy that has remained so elusively beyond their grasp for so long.

Guardiola said, whether it was fair or not, that his time at Manchester City would be judged on whether he was able to bring the Champions League to the club. Now that judgement can be made.

The Catalan, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, will now be an iconic figure at City as well as Barcelona.
• None 'Hysterical and hated at times' - but Guardiola is the greatest

It is a simple fact that many outside the Abu Dhabi-owned club will always view their triumph through the prism of the charges of 115 financial breaches brought against them by the Premier League, charges they fiercely deny.

For City's owners, with Sheikh Mansour attending only his second game since taking control in 2008, this was the night they have planned for and the one when they finally claimed that holy grail.

This was an evening when only the result mattered to City, not the manner in which their greatest victory was achieved.

This was not a win secured with the dazzling style and creation that is usually their hallmark. In fact for long periods it was a scrappy, sloppy performance in the face of a well-drilled Inter side who were right in this Champions League Final until the whistle went.

None of that will matter now. All that will be recalled forever about this game by City's fans was the moment when Rodri arrived on the end of build-up play from Manuel Akanji and Bernardo Silva to send that precise right-foot finish away from the reach of Inter's outstanding keeper Andre Onana.

And of course the triumphant Champions League trophy lift.

City lived dangerously in the closing minutes and, when it was all over, Guardiola, so agitated in his technical area, was relatively calm as he sought out opposite number Simone Inzaghi for consoling words.

John Stones was once again outstanding for City while keeper Ederson made key contributions when required.

The celebrations at the final whistle reflected a magnificent season as City finally got their hands on the Champions League trophy and prepared to parade it around the streets of Manchester along with the Premier League and FA Cup on Monday.

More than half of low income households in the UK are in the dark about bargain broadband deals, according to a new report by communications regulator Ofcom.

It is concerned people are not getting the right advice when it comes to switching to a social tariff.

Social tariffs are low-cost broadband deals offered to customers on benefits and cost between £10 and £20 a month.

Ofcom says millions of families could save around £200 a year by switching.

Although take up of these deals has quadrupled since January last year, the majority of people are still missing out on the savings it says.

One of the main reasons, according to the the regulator, is that families do not know about the deals.

Reduced social tariffs allow UK households receiving government benefits"
