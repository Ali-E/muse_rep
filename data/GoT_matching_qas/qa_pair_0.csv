Note: The user requested the answer to be the minimal verbatim span, so some answers use short phrases directly quoted from the text rather than individual words. For instance, "Nine days" is exact and requires no extra context, while "Will saw them" precisely matches the dialogue about the wildlings' confirmation. Each question is designed to test comprehension of specific details (e.g., character backgrounds, objects, environmental factors) unique to the passage. The CSV balues `a fortnight` and `ice storm` were excluded as they are not explicitly "seen" in the provided excerpt but are merely part of Gared's speculative dialogue. The focus was on unambiguous, directly extracted single or two-word details.
